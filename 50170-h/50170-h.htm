<p>The following trite sketch of the Philosophy of

of Mesmerism, Doctor <span class="smcap">Elliotson</span> and Doctor
<span class="smcap">Ashburner</span> of London, and Doctor <span class="smcap">Esdaile</span> of
Calcutta, in compliment and grateful acknowledgment
for having rescued from the fangs of ignorance,
envy, and self-conceit, the science of health and
knowledge&mdash;the science of Mesmerism, which unfolds
the hitherto unknown wonders of the Animal
system; and will unfold the wonders of the entire
universe, when the telescope and microscope are
familiarly used by the Clairvoyant.</p>

<h2><a name="PHILOSOPHY_OF_MESMERISM" id="PHILOSOPHY_OF_MESMERISM"></a>MESMERISM AND ESTABLISHED PHILOSOPHY.</h2>


<p>Long as clairvoyance has remained the riddle, jest
and wonder of the world, it is questioned by none
why the established philosophy of this superiorly
enlightened age is incompetent to account
for this or any other mesmerically produced phenomenon,
or afford the least glimmer of light by
which it were possible to arrive at the physiology.
Why the philosophy of Aristotle, Bacon, Newton,
Des Cartes, Davy, Liebig&mdash;honoured names, and
most justly, as the ancient and modern fathers in
science&mdash;can afford no scintillation whereby to lessen
the obscurity in which this most interesting subject
is involved, should appear strange and unaccountable
to all lovers of philosophy. By Professors the
question should be answered. To consider it unworthy
of being looked into, would be a tacit confession
that Professors are indifferent to the natural
truth; which proves all such to be but half reasoners,
and not philosophers, notwithstanding all their
mathematical learning and experimental experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>It should have been questioned long since, whether
the philosophy be not untrue which leaves all
mankind in the dark, in a mere physical case, however
mysterious the psychological result, the effect
of manual application, and in the power of almost
every person to produce. The mesmerising operation
and effect includes nothing of necromancy or
trick; is openly performed, and produced mechanically;
and although the passes make a living being
appear as if in a novel state of existence, the immediate
effect, polarisation of the extremities of the
body, is the same precisely as is effected on the iron
bar when passed along the poles of a loadstone.
This, and numerous other physical phenomena,
which to the present day remain unexplained, and
as if inexplicable, afford much reason for at least
the conjecture, that modern philosophy is not the
philosophy of physical nature; which, if not, it
must be false and misleading, inasmuch as there
can be but one philosophy, by reason of there being
but one species of matter throughout all nature,
and but one cause of action,&mdash;<i>the general pressure</i>.
From which it follows, that as the philosophy of
nature is that of matter universally, there can be
no physical phenomenon which it does not explain.
Therefore, the phenomena which modern philosophy
has neither laws nor rules competent to
explain, are so many proofs that the established
philosophy of the age is false philosophy; which is
provable throughout all its particulars, however
rash and adventurous may appear the announcement.
Besides, at the present day, there are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
different philosophies maintained; every profession
has its own; which is proof of the strongest nature
that not one is true, dissent from the truly natural
being impossible, so universally is it applicable.
Eventually it will be admitted that the philosophy
of the nineteenth century is founded on the crude
ideas of the imperfectly learned in the earliest days
of science, ever since adopted, and never investigated,
instead of being deduced solely from the
<span class="smcap">inert nature of matter</span>, the only true basis. On
modern philosophy, Davy makes the shrewd remark,
that "it is no better than a mere compilation
of isolated facts and circumstances, differently accounted
for, and leading to no general theory:"
such is not the philosophy of nature.</p>

<p>That matter is <i>inert</i>, is made manifest in there
being nothing whatever throughout the whole of
inanimate nature which can act or move of itself.
Matter does nothing, cannot act; it is the passive
patient of the general pressure, which alone can
act; and pressure is universal, because of matter
being <i>inert</i>. Matter is not only <i>inert</i>, but <i>unalterable</i>;
on which principles the constancy of the
order and laws of nature depend. Inert, unalterable
matter can suffer no change but of a local nature&mdash;change
of place, which implies motion, for which
there is no analogous cause but impulsive pressure.
These unquestionable physical truisms are stated
in advance, from being intimately connected with
every physical change, in order to serve as a
standard of comparison from which to form an opinion
while canvassing the principles and laws by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
which the scientific world has been for centuries
not only governed, but misled.</p>

<p>Newton admits the <i>principle</i> of <i>inertia</i>, but considers
it an innate <i>passive</i> power, which <i>enables</i> a
body to resist against being moved; and when in
motion, enables it <i>to resist</i> that which would put it
out of motion. <i>Inertia</i>, a passive power, is as death,
being passive animation; and <i>inertia enabling</i> a
body to <i>act</i> against force, is nothing short of <i>active
inertia</i>, or <i>vis inertiæ</i>, which means the force of
inability. This monstrous perversion of a natural
fundamental principle, and by such high authority,
pervades the whole of the established philosophy.
It makes the planets, which are but clumps of
deadly inert matter, gravitate themselves through
space; and makes <i>inert</i> atoms competent to perform
attraction on each other wherever they exist. A
more absurd article of <i>belief</i> has no place in the
Athanasian code of mind-perverting dogmas; yet
admitted as true by the most eminently talented
and highly learned of the present age. While such
inconsistent principles of common-place use are
gravely defended, the <i>known facts</i> of mesmerism
are obstinately and ignorantly denied; and only
because of not being understood; that, were it not
for the good sense and philanthropic perseverance
of the enlightened, noble-minded Elliotsons, Ashburners,
and Esdailes, of the British empire&mdash;honourable,
heroic champions and victors in the
cause of truth, humanity and science, in despite of
the self-conceit which affects the knowledge of the
limits of possibility; that, were it not for the magna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>nimity
of those superiors belonging to the learned
profession, this heaven-bestowed boon, carrying
healing on the wing to suffering humanity, would
have been contemptuously received, ungratefully
acknowledged, and long since consigned to the rubbish
of oblivion. Yet all have claim to the common
apology, <i>false scientific education</i>, excepting those
who have assented to what they have seen with
wonder, and afterwards denied their admission.</p>

<p>The established philosophy cannot account for
the boy's marble going farther through the air than
the fullest extent of the impelling thumb. The
proposition may appear trifling and insignificant,
yet is it worthy the consideration of the Chair of
Knowledge, from which it has never been explained
nor there understood, as involving the cause of
planetary motion; for, <i>in all nature there are not two
causes of motion</i>. That the marble "<i>partakes</i>" of
the <i>force</i>, and "partakes" of the <i>motion</i> of that by
which it is impelled, is an absurd idea; the force
and motion of a body were not, and cannot become,
the force and motion of any other body.</p>

<p>The established philosophy cannot account for
the splinters of a stone having motion out of the
direction of impulse, nor for having motion in every
direction but that of the stone-breaker's impelling
hammer, which appears at variance with the natural,
immutable dynamic law, which says, that <i>as a body
cannot move itself</i>, so must it have motion in the
direction only of that by which it is being moved.
Neither is there any philosophy extant, which explains
why the stone at Texteth of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
tons should rise, as if of itself, six inches in the air,
under which the quarrymen could have shoved a
hand and withdrawn it safely, before the immense
mass fell crushingly on the former bed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what the established philosophy
undertakes to explain, it explains erroneously.
Beside maintaining the transfer of a local
casualty, in accounting for continuous motion, it
teaches that the power of steam consists in heat,
and that cold congeals water: whereas heat and
cold have no physical existence; each is a sensation,
anything similar to which it is impossible for either
fire or water to possess. So that to the present
day the power of steam, the cause of combustion
and of congelation has in each instance remained
unknown.</p>

<p>So simple is nature, so few her laws, that were
any one of her phenomena known throughout all
its bearings, it would be found that the knowledge
includes the philosophy of the whole of matter.
Of this Aristotle was aware when announcing, that
he who is unacquainted with motion, is ignorant of
all things in true philosophy. Motion being the
<i>only effect</i> producible on <i>inert, unalterable matter</i>,
the knowledge of the phenomenon includes that of
all effect. The substance of all things being of the
same species, and the power of Nature consisting in
universal pressure, the formations in general nature
and in the laboratory of art can have but the same
principles, laws, theory, and philosophy. Paul may
plant and Apollos water; nature germinates, the
weather or climate grows and fructifies. The chy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>mist's
fire does not burn itself; in the absence of
air and its pressure there is no combustion; neither
is there growth, respiration, nor life.</p>

<p>According to the philosophy of the astronomer,
the earth has projectile motion, from "impulse
once impressed, at the beginning, and not since
renewed;" which is effect six thousand times, at
least, greater than the cause. Then, again, as
motion must be in the direction of impulse and
cease out of that direction, the earth, from "impulse
once impressed," goes round the sun without
being impelled; or of its own accord, and should be
centripetally attracted to the sun, if solar attraction
were possible. It needs no mathematical calculation
to prove, that, from such philosophy being
wholly independent of all consideration of natural
cause, it is untrue, and at variance with common
sense.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the chymist is of every-day
make. It assumes different species of matter; chymical
matter and matter not chymical; attractions
innumerable, such as chymical, electric, galvanic,
capillary, and attraction of cohesion; likewise magnetic
forces, chymical affinities, and affections of
matter&mdash;"while as yet there is none of them"&mdash;matter
being <i>inert</i> naturally. To mechanical nature
the entire is useless and foreign, and their value
lies solely in being terms of professional application
in the highly important chymical art; but to the
discovery of true philosophy they are an insurmountable
obstacle. How chymical matter differs
from the common matter of the world, no chymist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
can say or conceive; nor is there any difference in
the substance and nature of inert matter: as well
might it be maintained that motion is not always
mechanical, but sometimes chymical. The true philosophy
of chymistry is dynamic, the basis inertia,
the laws those of quantity and relative position.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the anatomist and physiologist
is semi-natural, semi-spiritual, mechanical and vital.
Life, throughout all belonging to the frame, does
not suffice; the heart and blood have each an imputed,
distinct, living principle; the nerves are
sensitive, the muscles irritable; the flesh has its
susceptibility, according to the modern physiology.
The sainted health-preserver shudders at the irreligious
notion of the economy being philosophised
on at all; more especially according to the laws of
hydrostatics; it being "impious beyond measure" to
reason on the work of God's own hand, formed
after his own image and likeness, (malformations
excepted,) as on human mechanism. Yet, where
are any of these vitalities and living principles
when respiration is suddenly stopped? Verily,
these professionals endow, most gratuitously, the
animal frame with as many vitalities and living
principles as the lives bestowed on the tailor's&mdash;so
much the more unfortunate&mdash;cat. As every organ
of the body is inert; no organ, of itself, performs the
function; every function is mechanically performed,
and every effect analogous to impulsive pressure,
whether consisting in formation, intermixture, or
dissolution, all depend on elementary local change.
The contrary is not in the power of the anatomist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
and physiologist to prove of inert, unalterable,
atomic substance; nor should more causes be assumed
than what are natural, common, sufficient,
and analogous to effects. Spiritual principles for
mechanical purposes are as little requisite for
animal organism as for the steam-engine, or the
performances of a watch.</p>

<p>The last on the list of professional philosophies is
that of the Therapeutist; the least misleading, from
being the most concise. The word <span class="smcap">action</span> includes
the whole. There is no inquiry to which the word
<i>action</i> is not the deeply-learned significant reply;
being indefinite, it stands for a dead-stop silencer.
The doctor knows best&mdash;with much room for
knowing better. The doctor knows, and assures
from his own certain knowledge, that the <i>action</i> of
the dose on the stomach upheaves the sac; but
rather than be thought positive, allows that the effect
may be from the <i>action</i> of the stomach on the dose.
The good easy man of M.D. celebrity, or mediocrity,
has to learn, that the dose is as <i>inert</i> as when in the
tea-cup, and the stomach as <i>inert</i> as when it has
arrived at the predicted destiny, the dissecting table.
Again, the <i>action</i> of the pain prevents the <i>action</i> of
the physic, otherwise the cure would have been
immediate. Such philosophy is harmless, if so to
the patient; from its insignificance it corrupts
neither pathology, osteology, nor dynamics. Not so
the learning, published on high surgical authority,
to enlighten ward-walking noviciates&mdash;that "pain
may exist in the <i>flesh</i> and bones without being felt,
owing to the <i>insensible</i> sensibility of the part," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
amounts to an excruciating, painless <span class="correction" title="In the original book: toothach">toothache</span>, and,
the being unconscious of excited consciousness.
Pain is not in the diseased or wounded part, being
the consequence of cerebral excitement; pain is one
of the objects of perception belonging to the scenery
of the sensorium, from which it cannot migrate.
The disorganised part is but the apparent place of
pain; and wisely such, or else all remedial applications
would be to the brain. As to the dose and
stomach <i>action</i>, it stands corrected by the diagnosis;
the stomach is lifted in consequence of the equilibrium
of pressure being destroyed by means of the
dose, notwithstanding its additional weight, within
the stomach. Chymical action of the dose and self-lifting
muscles are all of Esculapian surmise. The
faculty should cease to identify feeling, pain, sensation,
with organic ailments and disorganization of
the flesh.</p>

<h2><a name="ATTRACTION" id="ATTRACTION"></a>ATTRACTION.</h2>


<p>Attraction is the all-pervading, all-perverting sin
of the established philosophy, the scape-goat, on
which the blunders of illustration are heaped. Newtonians
endow every atom of matter with not only
an attracting property, but another, as if to neutralise
it&mdash;repulsion, which renders both useless; as if
to make matter both active and inert, naturally, and
as if Nature were planned on principles of complexity,
from having double the number of powers
the universe is possessed of atoms. One steam
power would suffice for the whole of England, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
appendages being feasible. How is solidity either
maintainable or attainable, while attracting atoms
are repelling atoms? The free, uncombined condition
of the atoms of the atmosphere, as well as their
<i>inertia</i>, proclaim their inability to attract each other;
and the mere crack in a pane of glass, that between
bodies there is no attraction. While it is left to be
conceived by the so-taught rising generation, that
the atoms of a bar of iron are busily employed in
attracting one another, and as busily in repelling
each other at the same time; and that the same
atoms are inert, the long-denounced aspersion
stands good, that there is no absurdity, however
great, into which philosophers have not fallen;
which is removable only by Philosophers, Professors
and Teachers coalescing to reform the erroneous
doctrines universally promulgated, which cannot
stand the test of rational investigation, and for
which, as National Instructors, they are morally
responsible.</p>

<p>Terrestrial attraction, attenuated on arriving at
the moon, and there sufficiently strong to prevent
the satellite having tangential flight, should be at
the surface of the globe at least two-hundred-and-forty-thousand
times stronger; yet here a puff of the
breath drives the dust into the air, and the smallest
winged insect is not restrained by the attraction of
the enormous magnet the earth is considered, from
escaping off the surface of the globe. There is philosophy
in mists, as well as "sermons in stones."
Rain should come down from above the clouds,
if terrestrial attraction hold fast the moon: mists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
and exhalations, by quitting the earth, solve the problem;
but we are ignorant of the philosophy, ways,
and expressions of simple nature; hence, ours is
foreign philosophy.</p>

<p>In attributing the fall of bodies to the ground to
attraction, it is overlooked that the earth's greater
attraction has to be exceeded by the minor muscular,
or explosive force, which caused the ascent.
The foregoing plain facts, although demonstrations
to the contrary are on record in the royalized
<span class="smcap">Transactions</span>, but without reference to the inability
of inert matter to attract, are certain proof that
attraction is founded on a guess-work basis. Hence,
that all learning is not knowledge is a moral certainty;
and that the nature of cause is not to be
arrived at by demonstrating the properties of lines
and angles, time has sufficiently proved.</p>

<p>Had the fall of Newton's apple been an effect of
terrestrial attraction, there should have been some
stronger attraction from somewhere above the tree,
to make the juices of which the apple was formed
ascend from the ground, and capillary cannot be
said to be stronger than terrestrial attraction. There
is nothing but puzzle, contradiction, and inconsistency,
in human opinion, where the natural truth is
unknown. Oh! apples, apples, why for discord
sent? the first cut short eternal life on earth; another
turned "heaven-born reason" to inventing
dreams;&mdash;that heaven-born reason which tells us
every day of its yesterday's mistakes.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY" id="EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY"></a>EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY.</h2>


<p>The Baconian precept, to "torture Nature out of
her secrets," has been, and ever must be, abortive
of the good intended. Nature is performing freely
and openly every hour, without making us wiser,
and as little while she is operating in our own
experiments. Her language, of which <i>inertia</i> and
<i>pressure</i> are the alpha and omega, is not studied;
nor does it mislead or flatter like our own. Experiments
innumerable have been performed; the <i>experimentum
crucis</i> resorted to; the screw applied to
the utmost pinch, without either confession or concealment
on Nature's part. Hence, the experimenter
is left to make his own philosophy of the case, of
which the next operator makes a different; and all
are falsely interpreted that violate the principle of
inertia, which all do. Aristotle, Bacon, Newton,
Black, Reid, Davy, Des Cartes, experimented
indefatigably under the most favourable auspices,&mdash;exalted
talent, and the institutions of the world at
command; but all on false principles; yet Nature,
tortured or not, left them to their own mis-interpretations.
Aristotle, true in his opinion of motion,
was himself ignorant of the cause of continuous
motion, or all would not be so at present. Bacon
recommended experiment, without teaching the
natural mode of interpretation. Newton spent his
valuable time, to the world's great loss, in experimenting
on light, in ascertaining and describing its
properties, as if there were material light; instead
of which, light is a mere sensible effect; hence, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
physical nonentity. Black and Reid called to their
assistance all the powers of numbers, to ascertain
and prove the quantity of heat in the animal system,
and of cold in ice; but could not torture Nature out
of the information, that heat and cold do not belong
to matter or bodies, as a knowledge of the function
of the senses could have informed them. Davy
travelled to Skehallean to find from the size of the
hill, a ratio of attraction, whence to calculate
the quantity of attraction in the entire globe of
the earth: at home, correctly sought, he would
have found, without numerical assistance and the
pendulum, that the amount is zero. The deflection
of the pendulum was caused by the pressure on one
side of the bulb being greater than on the side
facing the hill; which, from varying hourly with
the sun's altitude, should have told him that the
deflection is a mere weather-deviating circumstance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, who perceives the natural
truths elicited by even his own experiments! That
truly great philosopher, Priestly, remained ignorant
that his own experiments on blood and air brought
to light the principle on which the blood is arterialized,
without coming in contact with the air in the
lungs; of which experiments the faculty are reprehensibly
ignorant at present; also the principle of
congelation without cold. It is a general error that
men must be philosophers because they are mathematicians
and first-rate experimenters, yet do not
know what keeps the blood in motion, nor how
water becomes ice.</p>

<p>What experiment was ever so absurdly illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
as that of ice formed in the midst of fire; which is
explained by, "evaporation generating cold in a
red-hot crucible," and while maintaining that cold
is only the absence of heat. The <i>rationale</i> is: the
oxygen of water is the hindrance to congelation,
which the evaporation carries off, and the remaining
elements of the water are compressed into ice.
What are the elementary constituents of water, has
yet to be learned. Misled by false-directing philosophy,
the analysis of a rotten potato, in quest of
the cause of the vegetable epidemic, is as wise as
were the same scientific procedure taken on the
contents of a pustule to discover the cause of the
small pox: the result in both cases must be a
complete new formation; and in the former, the
result could be no preventive information whatever
to the planter. To convince planters and
remove all timidity, every garden owner should
plant an experimental patch with potato <i>peelings</i>,
each having an eye; the crop is certain and good,
and supplies the cottager with the next year's seed
at no expense. The <i>cutting</i> for seed may be of
exhausted vegetating power, while the peeling of
even the same potato may be as sound as ever. The
badly grown potatoes of the previous crop caused
those of the following to be of imperfect growth and
perishable: hence the general potato-rot.</p>

<h2><a name="PHYSIOLOGY_AND_FUNCTION_OF_THE_SENSES" id="PHYSIOLOGY_AND_FUNCTION_OF_THE_SENSES"></a>PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTION OF THE SENSES.</h2>


<p>By the popular expression, "Evidence of the
Senses," is universally understood, the perception,
or seeing external bodies by the organs of sense:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
yet externals are invisible and the senses insentient.
This mistake, common among the fathers of every
age, has corrupted the prevalent false philosophy
tenfold.</p>

<p>The eye is not possessed of sight; neither is
colour a property of matter, or it must be indestructible
by fire and every other means. The
senses should be considered as but mechanical
agents for exciting the brain; by which means it is
we have our knowledge, the particulars of the whole
of which are mental, confined to the brain, and
consist, solely, in the cerebral excited scenery of
the sensorium. We have no other kind or means
of acquiring knowledge, that is, mental information.
By the mere organs of sense we know
nothing. The knowledge we have by means of the
senses exciting the brain, consists in sensations or
sensible effects, and, <i>we know nothing but our knowledge</i>,
whatever may be thought of externals being
objects and immediate objects of our knowledge.</p>

<p>In describing what we know, it is imagined the
description is of external bodies, their appearance,
qualities, and properties; which, however harmless
the mistake throughout busy-life affairs,&mdash;as all
abide, judge, and are directed by the same kind of
evidence,&mdash;not so is it in philosophy, which is a
description of nature's own mode of procedure;
and although it is impossible to describe invisible
things, as they are really, they should not be philosophised
and reasoned on, <i>as they are not</i>; they are
not according to what we know, and can have no
resemblance in any manner to sensations, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
all we know by means of them. Instead of knowing
by the senses what bodies are, we know only
what they <i>are not</i>; modern philosophy is regardless,
totally heedless of this most instructive
most pointedly directing information, instead of
making the just allowance for mental appearances,
it materializes every sensation, and imputes the
whole to the bodies outside of our own, of which all
we can possibly know is but inferential knowledge:
it considers our sensations as being qualities of
bodies or properties of matter, and maintains that
some are physical causes by which certain physical
effects are produced. Such may be considered
some of the principal reasons why <i>clairvoyance</i> is
unintelligible to all the most learned; and so must
it ever remain, or until a truer philosophy arises
and rescues the great subject from the darkness and
errors of a perverting philosophy, the whole of
which has to be abandoned before the mind is fitted
for the reception of natural truths. We must cease
to identify sensations with their unseen, unknown,
and but <i>promoting</i>, material causes. In proof of
the foregoing, a short review of the senses, their
physiology, function, result of the function and use
of the result, must prove satisfactory and convincing.</p>

<p>The <i>physiology</i> of a sense, consists in an external
organ,&mdash;as the eye or ear, its nerves of sensation
which spread through the brain, and, the nervous
fluid. To each of the senses there belongs a distinct
cerebral organ, which, if deducted, leaves
nothing to constitute the physiology, but the exter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>nal
organ, the nerves, and nervous fluid; such may
be considered the physiology of all the senses, so
far as the exciting mental perception is concerned.</p>

<p>The <i>function of a sense</i> is, to act on and excite
the cerebral organ, when the nervous fluid is put
into an acting state through external circumstances.</p>

<p>The <i>result of the function</i>, is a sensation, of which
we have immediate cognizance, by reason of a sensation
being <i>a recent change in consciousness</i>. The
nervous fluid, not the tubular nervous <i>striæ</i>, is that
by which the brain is excited.</p>

<p>The <i>use of the sensation</i> is manifold. Emanating
from the wonderful Economy, is the law, that, <i>the
sensation which an external body promotes, shall, to
ourself, seem to belong to that body</i>.</p>

<p>The law is imperative. The sensation being apparently
at, and belonging to, the external object or
body, it is imagined the body is visible, seen by the
eyes, and of the colour, flavour, or odour known by
the sensation. The apparent place of the sensation
directs to where the body is situated.</p>

<p>No person thinks, when a rose promotes the
sensation of colour, that the object perceived is
within himself: without the sensation there is no
perception of red, and with it, nothing is perceived
or seen of colour or of the flower; so that, were the
object coloured or not, it is to the spectator invisible;
and as the sensation would be useless were
the object coloured and seen, it is obvious that the
flower is uncoloured, therefore is not seen: the seeing
an uncoloured object is a physical absurdity.
So is it with all sensations; they constitute the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
objects of perception with which we are acquainted;
and, such as they are in any respect, the outward
objects are in no respect. Sound is a sensation; a
sense has been provided that we should have knowledge
of sound; there is nothing of sound or noise
in the air; the function of the sense is not to hear,
but excite the auditory cerebral organ, and the sensation,
in which alone sound consists, <i>seems</i> to be
outside of us, and <i>seems</i> to come from a bell, but
which has nothing of the kind to part with; yet it
is imagined that sound enters the ear. Thus is it
supposed that the sensation externally exists, and is
sound heard by the ear. The philosopher so instructed,
calculates the velocity of the physical nonentity
sound.</p>

<p>Luminousness, light, colour, sound, heat, cold,
flavour, odour, are sensations,&mdash;each of the entire is
traceable from the function of the senses to the sensorium:
deduct these, there is nothing perceived or
to perceive; by means of the senses, respectively,
we have knowledge of each,&mdash;and by the senses exciting
the brain are the whole produced, as sensible
effects. Outward bodies can have nothing the same
or similar to sensible effects; and therefore nothing
of the whole belongs to matter or bodies, or to physical
philosophy. To mechanical nature the whole
would be useless; to sensitive beings only are they
useful; to us they are substitutes for Nature's deficiency
in these respects; and the whole present a
convincing proof of the wise, the strict economy of
the Great Architect in his works.</p>

<p>The objection is unfounded, that the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
object should be like the sensation, in order to produce
such sensation. But where is there sound in
musical string or in the metal of a bell to promote
the sensation; or yellow in the snowdrop to
promote the sensation of yellow, when the eyes are
jaundiced or a stained lens is before them: the sensation
of pain is not the effect of pain; it and pain
are one. That which in health promotes the sensation
known as sweet, promotes that of bitter in sickness;
the object is the same, the sensation changeable.
In reason it cannot be said that fire is like the
sensation, or the latter should be burning hot in the
brain, where it is excited; neither is any material
thing outside of us like a sensation of the brain; nor
does the sensation inform us of anything but itself,
excepting that it has a remote external cause. The
common show-box exhibits the same landscape picture
under the different aspects of summer, autumn,
winter, and spring, according to the stained lens
before the eyes; the picture has not all these colours,
nor any, it is a mere black and white print, in which
the stained lenses make no alteration. Nothing can
be like a sensation but a sensation.</p>

<p>That the objects we perceive and their remote
cause are distinct things, is proved by the perception
being that of a coin of the half-crown size,
when the eyes are directed to a shilling and a
convex lens before the face; if the lens be red,
yellow, or blue, so is the perceived object, which is
not the white shilling. We are invisible to each
other; what is imagined to be a man's appearance,
may be described as, various sensations of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
colours symmetrically arranged, and constituting a
single optically-excited mental effect. Neither is it
the likeness of the sitter that the canvass exhibits,
but the excited perception within the sensorium of
the limner; for the renewal of which it is that he
directs his eyes so frequently to the sitter's face,
which is invisible to the limner, although he feels
certain that he sees every feature.</p>

<p>Those who imagine the eye-balls look and see,
and that externals and the perceptions they promote
are the same, should, upon reflection, attribute
sight to their spectacles; for, as sight is nothing
bettered when the glasses are removed, so should
the temporary improvement be referred to the
spectacles having sight as well as the eyes.</p>

<p>In consequence of all mankind being similarly
organised, that which seems coloured, sonorous,
hot, acid, or aromatic to one person, is so to every
one else with sane eyes and senses; by which
unanimity of opinion, in these respects, prevails
throughout the great family of man, in the worldly
concerns of active life, and the social compact is
maintained indissoluble.</p>

<p>The all-wise, benevolent dispensation of the
senses, by which man's existence is supplied with
enjoyments not in all nature otherwise to bestow;
and his intellectual faculties provided with means
of contemplating the attributes of his Maker
through his knowledge, such as it is, of the creation,
which makes known to us not only God's regard for
his creatures, but his supreme omniscience in the
economy made manifest throughout all his works.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
Were bodies coloured as we imagine, there should
be an element of each red, yellow, and blue atoms;
elements of sound, heat, and cold; elements of
flavour and odour innumerable: whereas, by the
substitution of sensations, matter without any such
qualities, or any whatever, excepting that of being
everlasting, is made subservient to the formation of
a universe of worlds, teeming with beauty, harmony,
and wonders; all contributing to the comfort,
enjoyment, happiness, edification, and future
hope of its sojourning inhabitants.</p>

<p>Now, when from the established philosophy we
deduct gravitation, attraction and repulsion, which
are as foreign to inert matter as vitality to the dead,&mdash;the
host of chymicals, so repugnant to the principle
of <i>inertia</i>,&mdash;the imaginary living principles,
erroneously imputed to the mechanical organs of
the animal system,&mdash;the sensations of luminousness,
light, colour, sound, heat, cold, acidity, and of
flavours and odours,&mdash;when the entire of these unphysical,
mere nominals, are deducted from modern
philosophy, there remains nothing whatever to produce
action, physical change, or motion, excepting
<i>pressure</i>, which has been always looked upon as a
mere adjunct to the imagined numerous powers of
nature. When common sense has rejected the whole,
then will the philosophy of the Fathers be valued
by the world, as would be a garment with more
holes than threads.</p>

<h2><a name="MATTER" id="MATTER"></a>MATTER</h2>


<p>As a general term, <i>matter</i>, means substance; with
scientific precision, the term is confined to the elementary
state, in contradistinction to the term <i>body</i>,
applied to matter consolidated into solids and fluids.</p>

<p>Matter consists of atoms, which are hard, opaque,
<i>unalterable</i>, of homogeneous substance, of the spheric
shape, and naturally <i>inert</i>, therefore of inactive
essence; being <i>inert</i>, various species of substance
would be useless. The spherical shape admits immediate
atomic contact, and leaves interstices uniformly
throughout all bodies. There cannot be
either communication or alteration of the essence
of inert matter; and what the essence of unalterable
matter may be, is impossible, and would be useless,
to know.</p>

<p>An element is any volume of atoms of the same
size. There is no difference between elements but
in the size of their atoms.</p>

<p>Every element is a rarer medium to every other
element of larger atoms; the minor is as a partial
vacuum to the major, which involves the principle
of <i>inequality</i>, on which motion depends.</p>

<p>Correlative elements are any two, the atoms of
one of which are fitted for the interstices of the
other, and for no other interstices. Such elements
will naturally be together. On the correlative principle
magnetism depends.</p>

<p>All bodies consist of several elements; there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
nothing simple, but an element. Bodies are
divisible, matter is not.</p>

<p>All bodies include a portion of <i>elementary</i> or
<i>electric</i> matter, which is removed without injury to
their general texture.</p>

<p>Matter can suffer no change but change of place.</p>

<p>Weight is an accident of matter, the effect of
motion: all <i>effect</i> consists in motion; there is no
result until effect has ended in rest.</p>

<p>Rest being natural to inert matter, is no effect,
has no cause.</p>

<p><i>There is no power but impulsive pressure</i>; nor is
there any effect whatever attributable to <i>inertia</i>.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of <i>inertia</i> is that only
from which the philosophy of nature is deducible:
all philosophy is false which is not consistent
throughout with this universal, all-directing principle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The terms <i>electric</i> and <i>elementary</i> are of
the same signification, which is, <i>highly rare</i>: quality
and power to act are wholly out of the question
with the inert atoms of the elements of bodies and
matter.</p>

against which all difference in velocity and direction

<p>Impulsive pressure is the only cause analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
to the mechanical effect motion; pressure is universal
because matter is inert.</p>

<p>Motion is not natural to <i>inert</i> matter: the term

<p>As effect and cause are necessarily equal, so is
motion the measure of impulse, in time. Therefore
as long as a body is in motion it is being impelled,
however insensible the impelling cause. Motion
must be in the direction of impulse; for, as a body
cannot move itself, and is the passive patient of
impulse, so must its direction be the same as that
of impulse; therefore when the direction of motion
is changed, it must be by a novel impulse in the
novel direction.</p>

<p>From all matter being in motion, and all effect
consisting in motion, and because like effects everywhere
are attributable to the like or same cause,
so must there be a cause of motion as universal as
matter; rather than that there should be a distinct
impelling cause for every individual motion following
after the body, to put and keep it in motion.
In all philosophic research the golden rule of nature
should be held in mind, which prescribes "the
shortest mode and fewest materials:" <i>to mistake on
the side of simplicity is more wise than censurable
in the search after natural physical truths</i>.</p>

<p>A universal cause of motion, it would seem, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
be no other than a universal medium, a medium of
pressure, one occupying the regions of planetary
space, competent to keep the planets in interminable
motion and effect all terrestrial minor motion:
only by such means is it conceivable how the earth
can be under endless, ever-varying impulse, productive
of ever-changing direction. When impulsively
pressed into motion by such a medium, the
direction of a planet must be orbicular, on account
of the pressure on the solar side being always less
than on the opposite, by which the projectile direction
is diverted from rectilinear to curvilinear.</p>

<p>Newton imagined that a medium, and however
rare, occupying the regions of space, must retard,
in time destroy, and eventually require the hand of
Deity to restore the primeval order of planetary
motion: no very bright idea of the great mathematician,
considering the Omniscience of the Projector
of a <i>self-going</i>, <i>self-regulating</i> Universe. Whereas
a medium as dense as molten gold, could produce
no such disorder as long as impulse is greater than
resistance; which the long-continuance and order of
planetary motion strongly seem to indicate is the
case. Were there no medium in space, the planets
must be at rest; one could not possibly affect
another but by its shadow: Uranus being agitated by
the greatly remote presence of Neptune, is proof of
there being a connecting medium between. Gravitation
is supposed to move the body possessed of
the property, forwards,&mdash;why not every way?&mdash;to
the sun or towards some neighbouring planet,
but not to send that body or planet an agitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
warning of its presence. How is gravitation within
one planet to keep another in a state of agitation;
which agitation being motion&mdash;a mechanical effect&mdash;is
proof of there being a medium by which mediate
connection is maintained between the two, Uranus
and Neptune. Without a planetary medium there
could be no <i>system</i> of planets. Suppose the existence
of such a medium, then its sudden removal,&mdash;must
not every subordinate system, which makes
part of the universal system, become disjointed the
same instant? Besides, from the laws of vision,
rather of optics, there is equal proof that space
contains a medium. There is no light to come from
a star to the eye; there is nothing of sight belonging
to the eye-balls; and there must be something
between a star and the sense to connect the star
with the sense; or how is the sense or brain to be
so affected by the star, as that the perception or
sensation shall be always the same when the eye-ball
lenses are directed to the same star; and only
by a universal medium can all the stars of the
hemisphere be in connection with the eye at the
same time, or the time of a few winks of the eye.
Therefore until it is proved that constant planetary
motion can be without constant and equal corresponding
impulse, as to direction; and that a star
can affect the sense of itself, immediately or with
nothing between, all denial of planetary space being
occupied by a medium of pressure, is utterly untenable.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MEDIUM_OF_SPACE" id="THE_MEDIUM_OF_SPACE"></a>THE MEDIUM OF SPACE.</h2>


<p>Pressure being obviously the cause of planetary
motion, so is it of all terrestrial motion. To produce
atomic motion and transfer generally, it is
necessary, only, that the atoms of the medium of
space should be of less size than the minutest
interstices in bodies.</p>

<p>A universal medium must be of universal service,
(as would be conceived, were the universe
involved in a medium of water,) to be in accordance
with nature's economy: to keep the planets
and matter in motion, to retain atoms together,
and effect their separation occasionally, include the
whole of action required by its service; more in
this respect it cannot effect; nor is the common
general procedure otherwise effected. Therefore
in pressure, by the medium of space, consists the
<span class="smcap">primum mobile</span>: the beginning and end of all
physical cause of action and of all physical effect.</p>

<p>Pressure is nothing assumed, hypothetic, or unproven,
like attraction and gravitation,&mdash;the justly
dethroned imbecile usurpers of the imperial chair
of philosophy for ages past.</p>

<p>On barometric evidence alone, that pressure
exists all round the globe is fully proved; and
that it is indispensable to the maintenance of the
existing general order, all must readily grant who
reflect for an instant on the fatal consequences which
the cessation of the general pressure, for only a few
minutes, must cause. Hence it is no immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
question how the general pressure originated, how
maintained, what the confining boundaries or <i>point
d'appui</i>. Most likely it is the consequence of the
motion of the planets themselves, surging through
the ocean of space. As every performance of
nature has some ulterior object in view, it is probable
that the effect of the motion of a planet on
the medium of space is tributary to the motion of
another planet, and that the motion of the whole
is a means of preventing the cessation of motion
of any of the parts. Most likely the medium of
space was not in a state of pressure at first; that
planetary motion, however commenced, effected
the state of pressure necessary for its continuance,
and which would be useless beyond the precincts of
planetary evolution: where pressure is not needed,
of a certainty there is none. Hence the conclusion
is warrantable, that the general pressure, however
commenced, is maintained by not only the motion
of the planets individually but in systems, through
the ocean of space.</p>

<p>The earth may be said to swim through the
medium of space, and to be soaked with it as a
submerged sponge is with water, and the portion
within the globe of the earth, is continuous with the
like medium in space generally. By which all parts
of the interior of the globe are under the general
pressure equally as the surface, and all terrestrial
bodies subject to its vicissitudes.</p>

<p>By such means, only, is the great earthquake to
be accounted for on dynamic principles. Far as the
subterraneous grumbling extends, the physical cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
must be present, and in a state of force equal to
the awful result. No pent-up air suddenly set free,
or suddenly exploded gas,&mdash;both naturally forceless,&mdash;subject
to attenuation and obstruction in the
passage from the source&mdash;is competent to burst
the globe and hurl whole cities into the engulfing
chasm: nor is fire any assistant, judging from the
absence of flame, smoke, cinders, and ashes. Dreadful
as is the catastrophe, it is but a natural casuality
and in perfect accordance with the laws of matter.
An extraordinary rushing into the body of the
earth of medium of space, preceded by an equal
efflux of elementary matter atmospherically induced,
are the cause and promoting means of the extraordinary,
terrific phenomenon.</p>

<p>All things being under the general pressure, and
elementary atoms of all sizes everywhere present,
the interstices of bodies cannot remain empty. From
all interstices being formed by spherical atoms, and
the atoms of the medium of space the smallest, there
are always interstitial spaces for medium of space
to enter, pass through or remain within, and which
<i>is not insulated</i>, but continuous with the outward
source. Thus, has the medium of space access to
every atom, and by the pressure from without, is enabled
to act <i>centrifugally</i> within the body, as a kind
of back-spring against each and the whole of its
constituent atoms, to produce expansion, dissolution,
and elementary dispersion according to the medium
or circumstances in which the body may be placed.
These general principles admit of repetition, in
order, that, by repeated showing, to prove their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
validity, against others more generally known and
adopted, although unfounded in nature, sense, or

<h2><a name="MINUS-PRESSURE_MATTER" id="MINUS-PRESSURE_MATTER"></a>MINUS-PRESSURE MATTER.</h2>


<p>Taking the maximum of pressure as a fixed
quantity, or, as not being subject to increase, and
assuming the degree to be not less than equal to
the tenacity of steel, there must of necessity be
means of mitigating the maximum, so that in the
scale of descent every degree of force should be
attainable; and more, to keep the equilibrium in a
state of disturbance, without which all things must
be, and remain in the rest of death. Were there no
minus-pressure means, the solid, or perhaps aëriform
state of matter would exist everywhere, and of
motion there could be none. Such means for promoting
motion are amply supplied, and without
any addition of matter to the measured quantity
sufficient for the formation of bodies and service of
nature generally, in the elements themselves, of
matter.</p>

<p>As the body which is involved in a medium of air
is under less pressure than in a medium of water,
and still less within a medium of elementary matter,
so is elementary matter, and the elements generally,
the natural means of mitigating the maximum of
pressure on and within bodies. All bodies within and
on the surface of the earth, possess removable elementary
matter, which prevents superficial contact,
and excludes medium of space proportionally from
their interior; and because the medium of space is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
the cause of pressure, in being thus rendered discontinuous,
so is its force, as it were, intercepted
or lessened. For instance, a polished needle floats
on water, but when wetted or smoked is precipitated,
from having its electric or minus-pressure
atmosphere removed; from which it is obvious that
with the minus-pressure atmosphere, the needle is
under less pressure than when without it; and the
same atmosphere it is which makes the bed in the
water so much larger every way than the needle.</p>

<p>The minus-pressure principle is well exemplified
in the rise of water within a tube over which fire is
situated. When the fire is removed, the water falls.
The fire must be in the state of combustion&mdash;mere
ignition does not answer. The elements forced out
of the combustible, as combustion proceeds, cover
the orifice of the tube, and intercept the general
pressure, notwithstanding they are under the general
pressure. By such minus-pressure means is the
equilibrium destroyed, and by the unaltered pressure
on the water outside the lower orifice of the tube,
the water is forced upwards. So is it that the water
of the sea is raised to the minus-pressure, elementary
matter descending from a cloud in the shape
of an inverted cone, and known as the water-spout.
Astronomers can best say whether the sun
and moon be not minus-pressure means in promoting
the rise of the ocean, productive of the
tides; a miniature representation of which is effected
by holding a charged jar over a surface of water, to
which the water rises in a small cone,&mdash;which cone
follows every motion of the jar, and falls when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
jar is discharged. Capillary ascent is promoted by
the interposed minus-pressure electric matter which
fills the caliber of the tube: the same matter prevents
the horizontal flow of water through such
tubes; but when the tubes are de-electrised, the
flow is free and constant: boiling water, or fire de-electrises
all such tubes. The electric matter on a
bar of iron is a hinderance to water running down,
but when removed by means of fire, the water runs
down the bar freely. The atmosphere is a minus-pressure
medium to the earth, and on the general
principle that <i>interposed elementary matter renders
discontinuous</i> the medium of pressure, which is the
medium of space.</p>

<p>Minus-pressure means exist in other than the
elementary form, as in blotting-paper, candle-wick,
pledgets of lint. Within the cupping-glass, which
is empty of air only, it is the minus-pressure matter
obtained from flame which promotes the rise of blister.
Within the vessels of the vascular system, as
mucilaginous lining, minus-pressure matter assists
the circulation of fluids, on the foregoing capillary
principle. The slime on deep-water fish, seems
provided to lessen the pressure of the water on the
inhabitants of those seas. Minus-pressure matter
on one side only of a body, destroys the equilibrium,
and promotes the motion of the body; and generally,
the partial action, implied by motion, of the medium
of space on bodies or their parts, is promoted by
interposed minus-pressure matter in every instance
of physical change. Only in minus-pressure means,
which serve as a partial vacuum in some cases, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
disturb the equilibrium of pressure, is motion, or
change of place of the elements of bodies, or of
bodies themselves promoted: without such means
there is nothing to promote the blowing of a
wind, or to put the medium of space into action.
Cause being given, the <i>General Pressure</i> in the production
of every physical effect, the sole province of
philosophy consists in tracing out the minus-pressure
means which promote the occasional and partial
action of the medium of pressure.</p>

<h2><a name="FIRE" id="FIRE"></a>FIRE.</h2>


<p>Fire is not hot, although it burns the flesh and
promotes pain. Matter, which is unalterable, cannot
be made hot or cold, neither is there anything
to make it so. If a limb be made rigid, or the
nerves of sensation be removed, or the function of
the nervous fluid be obstructed, the limb may be
burned off unconsciously. Heat is a sensation
effected through excitement of the brain; out of
the brain there is neither excitement nor heat. The
fire does not excite the brain, but the nervous fluid;
and although the sensation is not hot, it is imagined
that the cause must be hot, which is false reasoning.
The chymist finds heat creviced in all things, even
those which he admits are destroyed by heat&mdash;gunpowder
and ice. How can flame be hot, when
just obtained from the gases of decomposed ice
water? or, if hot, <i>sui generis</i>, it must have been hot
frozen flame in the original ice.</p>

<p>Modern philosophy adopts different kinds of
heat,&mdash;<i>animal, culinary, and latent heat</i>. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
is our own feeling excited by means of fire in the
sensitive centre, the brain; also by exercise and
disease, in the absence of fire. How is the spark
from the flint or from the steel to saturate a bushel
of coal with heat? How, again, does "heat come to
an equilibrium in all surrounding bodies," when some
portion of the coal may be black cold, and others
red hot&mdash;using the popular terms&mdash;in the fire-place,
at the same time, and while the air in the chamber
is indexing zero? <i>Latent heat</i> is of the philosopher's
own peculiar making; and on the "<i>great discovery</i>"
the most unbounded praise is still bestowed. Latent
heat, "which all bodies possess without being
heated," which, "heats nothing," and is not hot, is
cold heat, and should be nomenclatured such, or,
absurd heat. Are not Instructors less than half-reasoners
and unnatural philosophers, who abide
by and teach such consummate nonsense: on a
par with which is the discovery of "latent dark
light"&mdash;"of black being formed by the intermixture
of two luminous rays at the point of intersection
in the spectrum," which is the same as
feelable darkness; after which, there only remains for
"<i>new discovery</i>," latent sound, for inking on, thence
vibrating from, a sheet of music-paper; and latent
motion, to keep a stone at rest, the quantity of
motion in the world having been already ascertained
arithmetically to a fraction; the last-day discovery,
the quantity of right reason, is the small remaining
trifle to be discovered. Radiation of heat and cold
by fire and ice, being inconsistent with the <i>inertia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
of <i>matter</i>, is an erroneous and greatly-misleading
assumption, although proved through the nicest
experiments, according to the experimenter's ideas.</p>

<p>Instead of fire communicating anything to bodies,
<i>fire promotes loss to everything</i> in its neighbourhood.
The bars of stoves, iron pokers, steam-boilers; all
culinary vessels; coal, wood, candles, paper, linen,
all suffer loss by means of fire; cinders, charcoal,
tinder, are but remains: to which it is no exception
that some bodies acquire substance and weight in
becoming oxydes; because, previous to acquiring
oxygen from the air, they must have lost elementary
matter to the fire to make spaces for the oxygen
to enter, otherwise the open air should oxydize
equally, in the absence of fire.</p>

<p>The loss, or matter of loss which fire promotes
to fluids, appears as air-beads on the sides and
bottom within the vessel on the fire, before the
water comes to ebullition: these beads cannot be
made to rise in the water by any manner of agitation,
which is proof they have not come from the
fire, and through the rigid bottom, or ascent and
escape are inevitable. When the bottom has been
sufficiently de-electrised by the fire, they are pressed
through it to the fire; or if the vessel be removed
and placed on the ground, they become dispersed
through the water insensibly. The like spherules
collect on an egg while boiling, which cannot be
anything issued from the fire to the surface of the
water, then precipitated on the egg. On the bottom
of a glass-retort suspended over a lamp, the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
spherules collect, from which it is supposed that
water never touches the bottom of any containing
vessel; it must touch that which it wets.</p>

<p>That air suffers loss to fire, is made evident by
the air being deprived of, or losing its oxygen during
combustion; and from both fire and flame becoming
extinguished in a limited quantity of respirable air,
in consequence of having lost its oxygen to the
combustible, while in the state of fire.</p>

<p>Solids, as polished metals and glass, when they
experience no change of weight, lose to the fire
imponderable elementary matter only. So is it when
the hand is presented to the fire, it loses electric
matter, and the loss it suffers promotes the sensation
of heat: when the hand afterwards touches a
body, supposed to be cold, it acquires elementary
matter from that which is touched. In every
instance the body, solid or fluid, supposed to be
<i>heating</i>, is losing elementary matter; and that which
is said to be <i>cooling</i>, is acquiring the like matter;
the hand <i>loses</i> to the former and <i>receives</i> from the
latter electric matter.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MEDIUM_OF_FIRE" id="THE_MEDIUM_OF_FIRE"></a>THE MEDIUM OF FIRE.</h2>


<p>A peculiar medium is formed within a fire, towards
the composition of which the fuel contributes
more or less of its elements; which is made manifest
in a piece of wood or paper when held within the fire,
being brought to the state of combustion, and without
touching the fuel, (heat, be it remembered, is no
more physical than shadow.) The like medium is
formed from the elements contributed by flame, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
whatever of elementary matter the atmosphere may
contribute beside. High above the flame of a lamp
combustion and fusion are effected the same as
within, or in contact with the flame. Between the
cupped hands this medium is receivable, and may
be carried from the flame of a candle to the wick of
a different candle just blown out, which it re-illumines.
There being little or none of the medium
of fire attendant on a detached ignited body, favours
the conjecture that the fuel during combustion
contributes somewhat of its elements towards the
formation of the medium of fire. Hence, although
not included in the nomenclature of chymistry or
any other, the medium of fire should have place on
the list of realities.</p>

<p>As all bodies include more or less of free elementary
matter, which excludes its equal in volume of
the medium of space, so to admit medium of space
in order to cause change in the constitution of a
body, the body must undergo previous de-electrisation:
the law is general.</p>

<p>The medium of space being the expanding and
decomposing cause, by means of its centrifugal
pressure within bodies, to prevent its being in
excess and effecting such changes spontaneously,
productive of the decomposition of all things, all
bodies are protected or retained in their present
condition by the electric matter within them, which
excludes the decomposing cause.</p>

<p>Within the medium of fire all kinds of bodies
become de-electrised; all suffer loss of electric
matter, which is succeeded by influent medium of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
space, the centrifugal pressure of which affects the
several changes to which bodies are liable previous
to ultimate dissolution into the elementary state.
In promoting the de-electrisation of every kind of
body, and to the extreme, which no other individual
medium or menstruum can effect, consists the universal
utility of the medium of fire.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
</div>
<div class="chap">
<h2><a name="EXPANSION" id="EXPANSION"></a>EXPANSION.</h2>


<p>The theory of expansion is of easy comprehension;
it consists in previous de-electrisation, succeeded
by influent medium of space, which, by
acting with centrifugal pressure, produces the phenomenon
of expansion. The general pressure is
the expanding cause, by reason of the portion of
medium of space within all bodies being continuous
with the medium of pressure in general space.</p>

<p>A bar of iron placed within the medium of fire
suffers de-electrisation; then acquires medium of
space, by which the bar is expanded. When taken
from the fire, it acquires electric matter similar to
that of which it had suffered loss, which displaces
the expanding medium, and now becomes contracted
by external pressure. The olden philosophy has no
contracting cause, the imputed attraction having
been destroyed by the imputed heat of the fire, as
the same philosophy states of the imputed attraction
of magnets being destroyed by the heat of fire,
which leaves the bar to contract itself.</p>

<p>A piece of lead on the fire becomes de-electrised
and expanded. The portion of medium of space it
has acquired separates the atoms of the lead by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
which the state of solidity is subverted; it remains
as one of the constituents of the lead, and is as a
menstruum to the metal, and the atoms of the metal
may be said to swim in it as the globules of blood in
the serum. Further de-electrisation and additional
increments of medium of space are productive of
complete dispersion of the atoms of the metal, and
of a kind of efflorescent result, which is a subsequent
formation. The air in a corked bottle before the
fire loses electric matter to the medium of fire;
and by the medium of space which enters the
vacated interstices, the cork is exploded. In the
partially exhausted air-pump receiver, that decrease
in the quantity of air should increase the expansive
power of the remainder, and that the atoms should
fly asunder with exploding force, is most unreasonable
and impossible. The physical fact is,
the more the air is reduced, the greater is the
quantity of influent medium of space, consequently
of expanding and exploding force. In the condensing
of air, as is the expression, by the piston of the
syringe, the quantity is reduced from being forced
out through the pores of the syringe; and pressure
on the bottom of the piston springs it up when the
depressing power is removed. Under the general
pressure the atoms of air must be in contact; and
the volume being reduced, implies reduction of
quantity: hard unalterable atoms are incompressible
beyond contact; and as to their being elastic, it
is physically impossible; medium of space being
forced out and re-entering, is what makes the air
be considered elastic. Let the syringe be worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
under water, and the matter displaced appears escaping
as air-bubbles, and as air-beads on the outside
of the syringe.</p>

<h2><a name="OXYGEN_AIR" id="OXYGEN_AIR"></a>OXYGEN AIR.</h2>


<p>All airs are compounds. Medium of space is
the most voluminous constituent of every <span class="correction" title="In the original book: acriform">aëriform</span>
body, which accounts for an air or gas and steam
being of so much greater volume than that from
which it had been obtained; steam has fifteen hundred
times the volume of the water it was produced
from.</p>

<p>Oxygen air is decomposed in converting it with
hydrogen to water: there is no oxygen or hydrogen
air in water; their <i>elements</i> are the constituents of
water. Oxygen is decomposed by respiration;
when inspired, it is not expired, but nitrogen, which
must have been one of its constituents, and from
there being nothing to constitute the expiration but
the previous inspiration the proposition is proved.</p>

<p>The constituents of oxygen are&mdash;nitrogen, <i>a
highly rare imponderable element</i> and medium of
space. The first is the most ponderable element of
nitrogen air; its atoms are the largest of all others
of the elements of matter, and, it may be said, they
constitute the substance of the framework of all
ponderable or gross formations. Davy says, "the
properties of nitrogen are altogether negative;"
the same applies to every other kind of air, all
being constituted of <i>inert</i> atomic substance, consequently
of inactive essence; and all being alike in
every respect but in the size of their atoms. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
imponderable element being highly evanescent, is
never found alone, and is always connected with
nitrogen; hence simple nitrogen is obtainable only
from bodies, or by deoxygenating atmospheric air.
Atmospheric air is nitrogen, plus the imponderable
element; and when the nitrogen is saturated with
the same element, the air is oxygen: hence, whichever
is inspired, nitrogen is expired.</p>

<p>From nitrogen being evolved copiously from
water in vacuo, and from ice being convertible to
nitrogen, according to Priestley, so is nitrogen a constituent
of water, also of the gases into which water
is decomposable; but as it cannot belong to the
hydrogen, owing to its superior levity, it must to
the oxygen; which is confirmation of the above,
that nitrogen is a constituent of oxygen air or gas.</p>

<p>How oxygen supports combustion no Elementary
Treatise explains; but leaves it to be imagined, that
oxygen is somewhat of a burnable nature, or that it
generates heat when blown into a fire. The fact is,
it supports combustion only mechanically. The
centrifugal pressure, by the medium of space, decomposes
the fuel; electric matter, entering the
ignited fuel, displaces medium of space, and the fire
goes out; oxygen prevents the entrance of electric
matter, and permits the medium of space to enter
the fuel freely, the pressure from without gives centrifugal
force. In this <span class="correction" title="In the original book: two-fold">twofold</span> manner of service
oxygen promotes the continuance of the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
decomposition known as combustion. A live coal
is greatly <i>deficient</i> of electric matter; when just
fallen from the fire it is said to be red and hot,
after a few minutes black and cold; all of which are
but mental effects. On the hearth the coal acquires
electric matter from the air, which displaces medium
of space, and becomes extinguished; so would the
fire were there no oxygen in the surrounding air.
Hence it would seem, that the interstices of oxygen
are too diminutive for electric matter to enter, but
are sufficiently large for those of the medium of
space to pass through, thence into the fuel. Should
the utility of the nitrogen of oxygen in combustion
be questioned, because nitrogen alone puts an end
to the combustion of a candle; it may be answered,
that, as the imponderable element of oxygen air,
from being highly evanescent, is not obtainable
without the nitrogen, and as by the service of both
together combustion is increased, so may both be
considered supporters of combustion; the grosser
element serving as a carrier to the minor, and, as it
were, giving it momentum sufficient to penetrate
beyond the surface of the half-decomposed, or previously
ignited fuel.</p>

<p>A piece of wood, like everything else when placed
within the medium of fire, suffers de-electrisation
and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: acquiries">acquires</span> medium of space: this twofold procedure
continuing, the wood becomes split or burst
asunder, and its elements gradually forced out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
the centrifugal pressure; some of which are precipitated,
some contribute to the medium of fire,
others are recombined differently and exist for a
short space of time as flame, and others, with matter
from the air, form soot. Such is the most rational
theory of combustion, consistent with the <i>inertia</i> of
matter and the absence of heat.</p>

<p>Friction rubs away electric matter, percussion
forces it out, combustion and ignition follow, and
without being promoted by either heat or fire. The
kindling matter of a coal-laid fire requires the
de-electrising spark at first, and the de-electrised
kindling de-electrises the coal; the wood fire, effected
by means of friction, is independent of even the
spark of fire for its commencement, from having
been otherwise de-electrised at first. Within the
fire, one part de-electrises another, and the centrifugal
pressure decomposes the whole.</p>

<p>Animal combustion is consequent on the internal
organs and flesh being de-electrised, the stomach
first, by means of spirituous liquors, which, like fire
in so doing, promote the sensation of heat. The
stomach and adjacent organs, from being thus de-electrised,
are prepared to receive the decomposing
medium; and from oxygen, to exclude electric matter,
being absent, the flesh is brought to the state of
smothered combustion and charred: it may now be
considered in the light of a <i>mortuum caput</i>.</p>

<p>The spontaneous combustion of greasy clothes,
damp hay and other things, is promoted by the
limited quantity of air in which such articles are
confined. To the hand the air seems warm before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
combustion has commenced, which indicates deficiency
of electric matter, but which, in time, the air
acquires from greasy clothes, and from damp hay,
the removal of which is succeeded by the destroying
medium, by which the elements of the combustible
become separated, set free, and dispersed.</p>

<p>In summer, when the atmosphere is greatly deficient
of what may be termed winter electric matter,
all woodwork is in a desiccated condition; and the
slight friction of limb against limb is sufficient to
make space for medium of space to enter in excess,
and convert to fire, tree after tree, the whole of a
forest.</p>

<p>The combustion of a candle is well worthy the
philosopher's attention. The candle while burning,
comprises a series of the simplest operations, and
far beyond the powers of art to effect or otherwise
imitate; yet from indifference to the familiar, and
the paucity of skill required in the construction,
there is nothing less noticed with philosophic
acumen. The mechanism and materials to be
wrought are the same; which consist in a slender,
compact, portable cylinder of tallow, within which
is included an equal length of wick. The various
operations of de-electrising, fluidifying, and gas-making,
are performed in silent, regular succession,
unretarded by friction and unincumbered with containing
vessels, Nature furnishes the power. The
wick answers the purpose of service-pipes, through
which the half-wrought materials are conveyed in a
gaseous form to the refining fire, within which they
remain as in a gasometer of supply, to be gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
diffused through the surrounding flame, and there
receive the finishing lustrous polish. The new
formation is now a refinery to the work in progress,
and is curiously situated over the materials where
only it could serve the numerous requisite purposes.
Nor does the gradual consumption of the
machinery derange the order of operation, work and
wear being carried on simultaneously to the end.
The many-coloured tissue wrought, of starlight
shine and of expanded base, is tastefully tapered as
if to please in appearance, as well as lighten our
darkness. Thus by natural means, operating on
almost uncostly materials, mankind are supplied
with that by which darkness is turned to day&mdash;the
candle flame.</p>

<p>All combustion is on the same principle, previous
de-electrisation the commencement, and, by the
same cause continued, the centrifugal pressure,
which is on the increase from being derived from
the general pressure. Flame, or the electric spark,
de-electrises the gases, oxygen and hydrogen, before
their conversion to water takes place; compression
effects the same. The inflammable air in mines
becomes exploded from the de-electrising consequence
of flame, when inadvertently exposed; and
at times the de-electrisation is effected by the
atmosphere, as in spontaneous combustion. The
mine explosion, promoted by the atmosphere, is a
case of spontaneous detonation, if not combustion,
which, from sad experience taught, should be anticipated
by the application of a rocket fired by a
train. The foul air should be got rid of timely, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
left to accumulate, and the weather dictates when.
"The Davy" may be said to insulate the flame of
the lamp from the electric matter of the air within
the mine. The flame, when exposed, de-electrises
the foul air, and in fluent medium of space causes
the explosion.</p>

<h2><a name="WATER" id="WATER"></a>WATER.</h2>


<p>Water is the most compound of fluids, although
when pure it promotes little or no sensation, which
is owing to the certain proportion of its elements
to each other. It seems to have, as constituents,
a portion of each of the general elements; of which,
when any are in excess or deficiency, the fluid
differs from common pure water, but still is an
aqueous fluid. All aqueous fluids which differ
from pure water, do so from elementary disproportion
in their constitution. Ancient philosophers
considered water the parent of all things, because
it contributes matter of substance and increase, they
said, to all kinds of bodies, and because there is
nothing elementary belonging to bodies which is
not obtainable, by one means or other, from water
or its productions. It contributes increase to the
whole of the vegetable kingdom, and through vegetable
matter to the increase of animal flesh. From
the vegetable world are obtainable, by means of art,
earths, metals, salts, acids, alkalies, even flame;
the primitives of which are of the same kind as the
initials of water; also of the atmosphere, which is
convertible to water, but is not water, by reason of
not only elementary disproportion, but the enor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>mous
excess of medium of space in which its
elements are involved.</p>

<p>The constitution of water being unknown, and
supposed to consist of only the gases, hydropathy
is condemned, like mesmerism, through the ignorance
and intolerance of professionals, themselves
falsely educated at best. As alimentary, water is
the most wholesome drink under heaven; as medicinal,
far beyond comparison with extracts from
metals and minerals, from which deduct the water,
the remainder kills. The hydropathic perspiration
cleanses the flesh from head to foot; physic, the
intestines and stomach only. Water is the elixir of
both body and mind; witness the persons who are
teetotallers. A patient declared to the present
writer, he would rather have run naked into the
street, were he not bound up by the wet sheets,
than endure the fog and stench from his body by
the cold water perspiration. Yet doctors insist
that hydropathy is not medicinal or curative, or
why not adopt the practice?</p>

<p>Water is formed by detonating the gases, oxygen
and hydrogen, by which their <i>elements</i> become
combined in the form of water; which is the only
formative mode pursued in the laboratory of art;
whereas, in that of nature, it is variously formed:
the number of elements determines the number of
modes. Suppose six the number of the natural
elements, then any five and the remaining one, any
four and the remaining two, or any three and the
other three, met and compressed within the atmosphere,
the product is water. On the meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
certain clouds, where <i>the gases</i> could not have
equal elevation, water is formed; and on walls
and wainscots, under cover, in humid weather, it is
formed from the electric matter on their surface
and the complement of elements contributed by the
atmosphere: the same walls, in the same weather,
would have no water, if kept de-electrised by
stoves. It is formed similarly on furs, woollens,
and the spider's web, all of which are retainers of
electric matter; and on the leaves of plants as <i>dew</i>,
but on the side only which is covered with the like
electric matter. Dew-water is neither a precipitation
nor exhalation, but a formation on that where
it is found.</p>

<p>Water is formed on glass and metallic vessels,
however closely covered, as long and no longer than
the included water gives out electric matter through
the pores of the vessel. In the air of the tropics,
the dew or water running down the outside of
covered and uncovered vessels, cannot be considered
humidity of the air condensed by cold. In proof
of the foregoing, the hitherto unexplained experiment
is opportune.</p>

<p>A plate of glass, covered on one side with tin
foil, has much dew on the naked side when uppermost,
and none, when the covered side is uppermost,
of equal dewy nights. The foil acquires
electric matter from the ground, which the glass or
naked upper side receives and retains; but when
the naked side is next the ground, the portion of
electric matter it acquires is conducted off by the
foil at top; and as where there is no electric matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
there is no dew, the upper coated side is dry, and
under circumstances which would have left much
dew on the glass side if uppermost.</p>

<p>Within the animal system various aqueous fluids
and humidities are formed, and, as in the former
instances, without oxygen and hydrogen being
present; namely, hydrocephalus, the stomach juices,
liquor pericardium, water of blister, milk, tears: to
these add the juices of fruit, the chymists' aqueous
fluids, together with the variety of formative modes,
and the complex constitution of water remains
unquestionable. Lavoisier's experiments proved
the same, by the endless variety in the residue and
product, from decomposing and recomposing the
same water several times. Davy states, that,
when experimenting on different substances, water
frequently appeared, when there was nothing sensibly
present to which it could be attributed, if not to
nitrogen, which disappeared simultaneously with
the water appearing: electric matter is everywhere
present, although not sensibly discoverable.</p>

<p>From which it is obvious that the alchymists
of old mistook the road to <i>El Dorado</i>. Instead of
aiming at turning the grosser metals into gold, they
should have alchymised on water, taking its elements
as the money-changer does those of the numeration
table, and by the rules of transposition made the
valueless stand in the place of most value.</p>

<p>Water in the boiler loses electric matter to the
fire beneath, and is expanded by influent medium
of space; the excess of the latter throws out the
elements of the superior stratum, which, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
enormous influx of medium of space, are the
constituents of steam and the power of steam.
The so-acquired medium of space, by the pressure
from without which it is under, is the cause of the
elasticity and force of steam. Steam is not water, nor
is it ever condensed by "cold." It consists in the
elements of water, less that which the water lost to
the fire: both, with a reduced or proportional
quantity of medium of space, make the original stratum
of water. What but electric matter can steam
receive from the pipes it may be passed through,
and is discharged from as water? Insulated,
"centrifugally repellant heat," without fulcrum, is
a most inconsiderable substitute for <i>the pressure of
nature</i> by the all-pervading medium of space, and but
a shadowy substitute in accounting for the powerful
effects of steam. There is no repellant force in the
flame of a candle; and what but influent medium
of space can make a pint of water fill and overflow
a quart vessel.</p>

<p>Water loses its fluidity and is made solid or
congealed, upon losing the imponderable oxygenating
element. Priestley through his experiments made
the discovery, that, "air, purer than atmospheric, is
given out by water at the instant of congelation,"&mdash;which
must be oxygen air. From which we learn,
that oxygen is the natural hinderance against the
waters of the globe being solid; with which experimental
practice and experience agree, it being well
known that oxygen added to a freezing solution,
retards congelation; and that, to facilitate the
freezing of water, a smart tap is given to the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
of the vessel, hitherto unknown why, but seems as
if to shake out the oxygen. The following observed
circumstances exhibit the congelation of water
throughout all its stages. The air in a chamber being
favourable for the reception of oxygen from water,
the water in a cylindrical earthen pitcher became
frozen; a plate of ice was formed, which equalled
the area of the vessel, and firmly fixed to the sides
one full inch higher than the water had been at
first. The bottom of the vessel was blown out, the
sides remained whole, and the ice not broken or
moved.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the case admits of the
following illustration. Medium of space, by its
pressure, forced out the oxygen; additional increments
of the same medium entered, collapsed the
elements of the deoxydated stratum of water, and so
forcibly expanded the rest of the water as to make
it explode the bottom of the vessel, all at the same
instant. As all excess of medium of space retired
from the water, the latter sunk to the original
height; and had not the water escaped, it would
have been an inch separate from the plate of ice.
A river thus frozen, flows freely beneath the ice
from the same circumstances. The bomb-shell at
Hudson Bay was exploded by the expanded water,
not by the newly-formed ice; or else the sides, not
the bottom of the earthen vessel, would have been
exploded.</p>

<p>Ice is deoxygenated water, and abounds with
electric matter, hence it floats; and ice-water is
at the minimum of density from being deficient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
oxygen. Ice, in a Florence flask, hung over a lamp,
yields abundance of electric matter, towards the
formation of lamp-black on the outside of the
bottom of the flask, which, to the miniature painter
may be preferable, from being the freest of grit. In
all cases of combustion, the elements of lamp-black
are present; so that, in combustion of the diamond,
the same kind of soot being formed, affords no
information of the constituents of this highly-prized
crystal. With more reason than that of pure
carbon, (which is but another name for the electric
matter which is the principal constituent of ice,
and lamp-black) being the base of diamond, it may
be assumed, that, diamond is a crystalized oxyde of
water. The electrician's opposite characteristics of
the two, diamond and ice, accord with the suggestion.</p>

<h2><a name="SOLVENCY" id="SOLVENCY"></a>SOLVENCY.</h2>


<p>The menstruum is supposed to <i>act</i> by "chymical
attraction," from having "chymical affinity" on the
involved "chymical solid," which enables it to
draw out the elementary atoms of the solid:
whereas the <i>inert</i> menstruum does nothing; it is but
an interstitial recipient for the atoms to be forced
into, as they become centrifugally forced out of the
solid. And because the atoms of a body are of
different sizes, some make novel interstices, and
thus expedite the dissolution. Only by increasing
the number and kind of interstices, can diluting a
menstruum with water increase what is imagined
to be its solvency. Neither chymical properties,
nor chymical strength of a fluid, if it had any such,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
could be increased by dilution, and the stronger
should dissolve that which the weaker is said to
dissolve. The contrary supposes that the force
which breaks a stone is too strong to break a nutshell.
Mechanical dissolution by the centrifugal
pressure is independent of <i>chymicalities</i>.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="GASTRIC_SOLVENCY" id="GASTRIC_SOLVENCY"></a>Gastric solution</h3>
<p class="p-h3"> is effected similarly: the juice
has none of the chymical properties of Liebig, nor
does ingestion stand in need of the living principle
of Coombe; the former are imaginary, the latter is
denied from gastric solution taking place in a tea-cup.
The gastric juice is an interstitial receiver of the
elements of the pulp, when forced out by the centrifugal
pressure into the gastric menstruum, as those
of soap into water. The pulp and its <i>striæ</i> are
disunited, mechanically decomposed, not abraded:
some of its elements escape into the air within the
stomach, which, by disturbing the equilibrium
within, promote irregularity of pressure on the
outside of the sac, which causes the <i>pliæ</i> to be in
the peristaltic motion, supposed to be caused by
the stomach stimulating itself. The same circumstances
take place within and without the intestines.
The whole process of digestion is dynamic,
in which the only stimulant is pressure.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the various conjectures on the origin of the
gastric juice, there cannot be any more unreasonable
than that which considers it a fluid <i>sui generis</i>,
and as having origin out of the stomach. All fluids
are compounds; and those belonging to the body
may be said to be formed out of, or by commixture
with others. To suppose for an instant, that a fluid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
which is <i>destructive of all flesh</i>, should have existence
out of the stomach, and remain harmless in
some <i>fleshy</i> vessel as long as the stomach is empty
of food, or until food is required to "stimulate" its
flow from without through the <i>papillæ</i> of the villous
lining into the stomach, is a most strange physiologic
oversight. Why not rather conclude at once,
that the flesh-destroying juice exists only where it is
required and for immediate service, and where only
there are preventive means, the peristaltic motion,
against it proving injurious to the flesh of the stomach;
and to the vessels of secretion it would be injurious,
hence, not as the juice but chyme it is passed
out of the stomach into the system. Under such
circumstances, the suggestion is nothing unreasonable,
that, <i>there is no gastric juice out of the stomach,
nor within, but while there is food present
to contribute one or more of its elements to the
other juices, including the saliva, towards effecting
its completion as a fit interstitial gastric menstruum,
for receiving the elementary constituents of the
pulp under mechanical decomposition by the centripetally
disuniting pressure of the medium of
space</i>. Like the all de-electrising medium of fire,
which exists only where and while it is being
formed, the gastric juice should be looked upon as if
<i>designed to be of difficult formation</i>; made more so
by depending on the food for its completion, which is
not a matter of "observation" within the stomach,
or in the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: teacup">tea-cup</span>: neither is the perfect juice, which
may be sponged or syringed from the bottom of the
stomach, any proof that as such precisely it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
from the <i>papillæ</i>, as some suppose. As to the
papillary flow being <i>stimulated</i> by the food, with as
bad philosophy it might be said, charmed; or that
clockwork is <i>stimulated</i> by the weights. The flow
is promoted by the pulp, as were the latter a piece
of sponge. And that the papillary flow is but a
constituent, not the flesh-destroying juice, in promoting
ingestion, is evident from the hunger pain it
promotes while harmlessly accumulating out of the
stomach, indicating the stomach being empty; and
the relief experienced at its source when discharged
into the stomach, it is, which has given rise to
the idea, that certain organs <i>sympathise</i> with the
stomach.</p>

<p>Such metaphorical expressions may pass for the
poetry of pathology, but hitherto have stood in the
way of deep research. Ingestion is expedited by
sleep, in consequence of the accumulation of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: minus pressure-matter">minus-pressure
matter</span> in the gastric region and stomach
at the time; and sleep is promoted by imperfect
mastication causing a deficiency of saliva in the
stomach which is compensated by <span class="correction" title="In the original book: minus pressure-matter">minus-pressure matter</span>
of the thus provoked comatose flow. The
pollparrot masticates but little, if at all, and sleeps
regularly after breakfast.</p>

<p>There is none of the inspired oxygen returned to
the lungs by the circulation. What becomes of it,
or what its use within the system, has not been
written for our learning. It is not retained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
blood, nor is it animalised; nothing yields less
oxygen than animal matter. To convey "carbon"
out of the system, and somehow purify the blood, is
the supposed service; but if so, should it not be
included in every expiration and of the inspiration
quantity? but which is not the case.</p>

<p>Harvey proved that the blood circulates, but left
undiscovered what keeps in motion the <i>inert</i> fluid,
except the systole, which the <i>inert</i> heart cannot
effect on itself. No organ can do anything of itself,
the whole being composed of inert substance, and
nothing else; even the life of the body, whatever it
may be, leaves the function of every organ, not
excepting that of the brain, dependent on the
general pressure.</p>

<p>By the general pressure the air is forced into,
but not through or beyond the lungs which it
inflates, and inflates nothing else. Within the
blood-vessels it would prove fatal; and although
from it the blood derives that by which it becomes
arterialised, yet the blood and air do not come in
contact, extravasation and pulmonary rupture must
happen, did the lungs permit the blood and air
coming together, or in immediate contact. Of the
air of an inspiration, the oxygenating imponderable
element only can permeate the pulmonary tissue.
This element it is which imponderably arterialises
the blood; the nitrogen of the inspiration constitutes
the immediate succeeding exspiration.</p>

<p>The oxygenating element promotes the circulation
on the same principle that it promotes combustion;
its diminutive interstices exclude electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
matter, which coagulates, and admits the propelling
force, medium of space, which is the only cause of
motion, to enter the blood. The oxygenated blood
being propelled, or pressed, by the medium of space
it includes, from the lungs into the ventricle, the
collapse, or systole, takes place, and the blood is
forced out of the ventricle, through the auricle, into
the aorta, thence through the several branches of
the arterial system, to and through the capillaries,
into the veins. Thus, from the medium of space
within the blood being continuous with the medium
of space generally, it is manifest that the blood is
circulated not by the systole, but by the general
pressure. To produce the systole, there is nothing
but the normal pressure on the outside surface of
the heart; nor, to lessen the normal pressure on
the parietes of the ventricle, is there anything but
the arterialising, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: minus pressure">minus-pressure</span>, imponderable
element of the blood just received into the
ventricle.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire of the arterial flow, the
blood is losing the arterialising <span class="correction" title="In the original book: minus pressure">minus-pressure</span>
matter to the different organs, as the means by
which the functional action of each is promoted.
Without such means, there is nothing to disturb
the equilibrium of pressure on an organ to produce
organic motion, action, or function. Hence, it
appears, that the use of the inspired oxygen consists
in promoting the circulation of the blood and
the functional motion or action of the different
organs within the frame.</p>

<p>Before entering the veins the blood is fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
deoxygenated; within them it acquires gradually
electric matter, productive of the livid or coagulating
appearance; at the same time the blood-propelling
medium is lessening in quantity; but which
is compensated in the mucilaginous lining of the
veins, which assists the venous flow on the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: minus pressure">minus-pressure</span>
capillary principle; capillary attraction
would collapse the vessels. The electric matter
collected by the venous blood is got rid of in the
lungs, and expired with the nitrogen and a remnant
of the oxygenating element of the last inspiration;
hence the small portion of carbonic acid gas
obtained from the expiration.</p>

<p>After all organic service, the arterialising minus-pressure
matter is insensibly transpired, which is
inferable from the supply being continued through
respiration; which, although constant, yet, from
being intermitting, might, perhaps, cause corresponding
stoppings in the round of organic
action; hence it would seem that, against such
intervals or interruptions taking place, the liver
has been designed to collect for casual distribution
a portion of the same minus-pressure matter. The
great surface of the liver may stand comparison
with the plate, or cylinder, of the electrifying
machine, and the organs as jars which receive
electric matter from it, as each stands in need.</p>

those of the diaphragm first; thence through the
umbilical cord to the fetus, in which the circulation
is indispensable, from being the only means of
conveying and dispersing throughout the body, in
the absence of respiration, the minus-pressure
matter which the organism of the fetus requires to
promote the several functions, without which life
would become extinct if commenced. In this
supply of motion promoting elementary matter,
consists all that can be considered <i>aeration</i> of the
blood, and all that the blood of both the fetus and
the <i>adult</i> requires, or can possibly receive. In the
chirping chick, while within the yet unbroken shell,
aeration is <i>prevented</i> by incubation of the mother
bird; but the arterialising elementary matter is
amply provided within the larger, apparently
empty, end of the shell. To keep out electric
matter, which would exclude the blood-moving
medium, is the object of the hen sitting on the
eggs, and oven-hatching is effected on the same
principle.</p>

<h3><a name="DIAPHRAGM" id="DIAPHRAGM"></a><span class="correction" title="Inserted from the Table of Contents.">How the Diaphragm Is Raised.</span></h3>
<p class="p-h3">&mdash;
The <i>diaphragm</i> cannot rise of itself, and has no
self-acting, self-lifting nerves or muscles, all flesh
being composed of <i>inert</i> atoms. The rise is proof
positive that pressure is greater on the posterior
than anterior surface of the membrane, and the
unchanged normal pressure beneath indicates reduced
pressure above; the latter is promoted by
minus-pressure matter imparted by the splenic
blood to the diaphragm, while passing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
vessels of the diaphragm. This arterialising matter
being highly evanescent, escapes from the diaphragm
and upwards, and during the escape mitigates
the pressure, intercepts it in some degree
from the superior surface; then, by the normal
pressure beneath, the rise of the diaphragm is
effected. As the escape, or separation, is becoming
complete, the equilibrium is being restored, and the
diaphragm depressed to the normal level. If this
be not the rationale of diaphragmatic motion, it
will be little improved by the substitution of
muscular energy, leverage, or muscular vitality,
while leaving out <i>muscular inertia</i>, which should
not be omitted, but included, in accounting for
every muscular action and motion.</p>

<p>Any pair of the general elements, the interstices

<h2><a name="MAGNETISM" id="MAGNETISM"></a>MAGNETISM.</h2>


<p>Were attraction a property of the atomic substance
of the loadstone, it could be neither transferable,
receivable, nor liable to be destroyed by fire.
A magnet is a work of art, the substance is inert,
it can no more attract than think. Magnetism is an
accident of matter; it consists in the correlatives of
an iron bar having become separated, and drawn
one to each end of the bar: separation and
transition to the extremities of the bar, are what the
rubbing on the poles of the loadstone effects.</p>

<p>Two paving-stones hanging a short distance asunder
and touched by nothing but the tranquil air,
remain at rest; but should attract each other
had "every atom in creation" the property. Were a
vacuum, partial vacuum or air much rarer than
atmospheric, now placed between the suspended
stones, each would be in motion towards the other
the same instant. Here both <i>causes</i>, the general
pressure, and the minus-pressure, or motion <i>pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>moting</i>
means, are given; the latter are sensibly
present, and the absence of attraction is as evident
as the inutility of anything of the kind to effect the
mutual approach of the two bodies. Not so is the
approach of two magnets understood, because the
intermediate minus-pressure means <i>present</i> are not
sensible. That iron magnets do not move together
by attraction, or that attraction is not the cause of
the phenomena imputed to it, is proved in the case
of iron-filings dropping from a bar, when the connection
of the bar with the galvanic battery is
broken; and it will not be contended that the galvanic
current is attraction.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a knowledge of wherein
consists the means which subvert the equilibrium
between two suspended magnets, reference has to
be made to the artizan's mode of operating in converting
the unmagnetised bar to a magnet. He
holds the bar in the middle, and draws one half
along the pole of a loadstone; then draws the other
half along the other pole, and after a few such
alternate <i>rubbings</i> against the poles, the bar is a
polarized magnet. From which it was formerly
supposed, that iron contains a magnetic fluid which
the loadstone rubbings divide, and draw half to
each end of the bar. But were such the fact, the
ends or poles should be <i>equals</i>, whereas they are
magnetic opposites. Now, with more reason, it is
considered that iron includes two different, removable
elements, (correlatives,) which, by the manipulation
on the loadstone, are drawn one to each end
of the bar, and there remain as polar atmospheres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
and constitute what are termed the polarities, or
opposite polarities of the bar; the latter opinion is
somewhat confirmed by the corresponding manner
in which iron filings, while being scattered on a
sheet of paper, become arranged round the poles of
a magnet lying under the paper.</p>

<p>The magnetic relation, which the polar atmospheres
of any iron magnet bear to those of every
iron magnet, being the same as exists between the
polar atmospheres of every individual magnet,
makes manifest, that a certain pair of correlative
elements is common to all magnetisable iron; but
without concluding that, by the same kind of correlatives,
the polarities are produced in bodies not
ferruginous, which, if the physical fact, so may the
animal correlatives be different in some instances.
From which it follows, that no one mesmeriser can
affect mesmerically every person, nor any one person
be so affected by all mesmerisers. Neither are all persons
"nervous" alike, which should moderate the war
cry against mesmerism generally because of failure
in some cases; and should awaken the philosophic
mesmeriser, willing to make perfect the science, to
investigate the cause of exceptions and difficulties.</p>

<p>Now, as respects the interposed minus-pressure
means or matter, which, by destroying the equilibrium,
promote the approaching motion of two suspended
magnets; there is nothing whatever to refer
to, but the magnets themselves, that is, their polar
atmospheres, which, together or facing one another,
make a rare or minus-pressure medium between the
proximate ends, into which both magnets are moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
by the greater pressure on their remotest ends. It
lies with the previously-instructed patient, while
clairvoyant, through questioning by the mesmeriser,
to make close observation, and report all
circumstances respecting the magnetic lights; also,
those attached to and proceeding from the mesmeriser,
towards elucidating this most of all recondite
subjects&mdash;magnetism, in the philosophy of
physics. The mesmeriser should hold in mind,
that, probably the air between the facing ends of
two magnets is magnetically affected, that is, made
a magnet in the series by the other two; which
seems to be the case when the patient is magnetised
at a distance from the mesmeriser by means of the
pointed finger, and by the <i>effect</i> of will at a much
greater distance.</p>

<h2><a name="NATURAL_SLEEP" id="NATURAL_SLEEP"></a>NATURAL SLEEP.</h2>


<p>That sleep is not at the command of will is certain,
or why undergo the tedium of a restless night?
Before the state of sleep can obtain, the body has
to experience an <i>electro-physico</i> change, by which
the extremities are left polarised and the body an
animal or living magnet. That the extremities are
polarised during sleep, is admitted by all physiologists;
for the effecting of which there must be a
pair of correlative elements concerned. While the
elementary transfer, productive of the polarities, is
taking place, so is drowsiness; when sleep has
obtained, the natural magnetising procedure has
terminated; hence from the degree of polarity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
mesmeriser can determine the stage to which the
patient has been brought between the comatose and
clairvoyant states, and know the capability of his
patient for being made clairvoyant or not; this
polar index should be well noticed.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="COMATOSE_FLOW" id="COMATOSE_FLOW"></a><span class="correction" title="Inserted from the Table of Contents.">Comatose Flow.</span></h3>
<p class="p-h3">&mdash;
It must have been observed by many persons
while dozing and the body in a sitting or leaning
posture, that an agreeable warm glow arises in the
chest, which increases while passing sensibly through
the pectoral towards the gastric region, and which
terminates, insensibly, in the consummation of
sleep; from the feet upwards a similar, but less
perceptible, flow takes place. Of this twofold
<i>comatose flow</i>, the immediate consequence is polarisation
of the extremities; sleep is a remote, but not
the remotest consequence, when effects similar to
those by the flow are mesmerically effected. Thus
it appears that the theory of sleep and magnetism
is the same. The magnetising procedure, however,
has this difference; the magnetic correlatives are
drawn from the middle to and out of the extremities
of the bar; those of the body of the patient
recede from the extremities to the central region,
leaving one, the correlative of the other, at each
extremity, in both cases.</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing theory of sleep is described from
immediate personal observation. While leaning
over a table, the doze heavy, the comatose flow
distinctly felt in its agreeable downward progress
through the chest, when, just at the instant of forgetfulness,
the violent slam of a door drove away
all chance of sleep under the following circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>stances:
a sensible and sudden revulsion upwards,
a few seconds of giddiness, and a smart painful
stroke on the stomach took place, all in quick succession;
which may be accounted for thus: the slam
prevented the correlative fluids from the opposite
extremities meeting centrally; each gushed irregularly
back, and depolarized its extremity, the
suddenness of which caused the giddiness. The
stroke is the true electric shock, inflicted by the
medium of space suddenly rushing or falling on the
stomach, from which the matter of the comatose
flow had been as suddenly displaced. Taking all
circumstances into consideration, it is manifest that
the state of sleep is the result of a natural magnetizing
operation.</p>

<p>Before the fire, while reading, the superior extremity
loses electric matter to the fire, which leaves
it polarized and promotes the comatose flow.
The lower extremity becomes polarized simultaneously
with the upper as a correlative consequence.
Sleep is supposed to be expedited by heat; hence
the afternoon's nap is seconded by a silk handkerchief
thrown over the head, but which is only a
hindrance to electric matter, similar to that of the
comatose flow entering from the air and depolarizing
the extremity. The handkerchief, from being
a non-conductor, only prevents the coming sleep
being retarded; it could neither generate nor
multiply heat.</p>

<p>Naturally it might be questioned, why the body
should become somnolent daily; and, by what means
the comatose flow is naturally effected;&mdash;of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
it could not take place. The languor removed, and
renovation of muscular strength through sleep,
may satisfy in the first instance. Next, it would
seem, that, as the functions of the several organs
depend on the presence of minus-pressure matter
for unequalising the pressure on each organ, so must
there be waste, loss, and daily deficit of minus-pressure
matter; which, from being made good by
means of sleep, leaves it inferable, that the daily
quantity derived from respiration may be little
more than sufficient for the continuance of animation
under the minimum of bodily exercise; but as
man is necessitated to follow laborious avocations,
so is it designed, that the loss by service and waste
shall be the means whereby the necessary re-supply
is to be furnished. The loss leaves the extremities
polarized; and as greater waste towards total
exhaustion approaches, the matter of the comatose
flow becomes needed and is employed in prolonging
the functions of the different organs, and before
exhaustion is complete the body is in the state of
sleep; during which, from every inspiration being
far more lengthy than ordinary, the body is resupplied
to repletion with the respirable minus-pressure
matter, by which the extremities are
depolarized, and the sleeper is awake, refreshed and
invigorated. From which it may be said, that a
man toils himself to sleep, and sleeps himself
awake; and that, not "balmy sleep," but respiration,
is "tired Nature's sweet restorer."</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="MESMERIC_SLEEP" id="MESMERIC_SLEEP"></a>Mesmeric sleep</h3>
<p class="p-h3"> may be considered forced sleep.
It is effected with little or no comatose flow, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
renders replenishing by long breathing unnecessary;
and the patient, on being awakened by demagnetising
the extremities, is rather debilitated than
refreshed.</p>
</div>

<p>Every finger of the mesmeriser is a magnet to
the magnetic correlatives within the extremities of
the patient; and the passes polarize after the
manner of the comatose flow in the case of natural
sleep. From there being no mesmerically-effected
comatose flow, there is reason to infer, that <i>the contents
of the nerves of sensation only are what the
passes polarize</i> and what only are polarized in
natural sleep, although expressed by the word,
<i>extremities</i>.</p>

<p>Repetition of the passes separates, or de-electrises
more completely the nerves of the extremities, than
for the production of natural sleep is requisite.
Hence it may be said, that the body of the <i>mesmerised</i>
patient is in magnetic advance, and hence
the series of surprising consequences which bring
to light more and more the wonders of the
economy.</p>

<p>The passes should be conducted on magnetising
principles; that is, from the extremities to the
gastric region to bring on somnolency, and from
the same region to the head and feet or extremes
to awaken; from head to foot is unscientific, and
might be prejudicial; the central region of the body
should be considered <i>the mesmeric insuperable line</i>.
Cross passes having been found efficient are not
anomalous, by reason of the nerves and branches
lying in all directions.</p>

<h2><a name="VISION" id="VISION"></a>VISION.</h2>


<p>According to the popular opinion, which governs
the philosopher, and with which the established
philosophy agrees, vision is an act performed by the
eye, which is said to be endowed with the faculty
of sight, by which it is enabled to look into,
through space, and see external bodies made visible
when covered with solar or day light; nothing of
which is true. The eyeball is not possessed of
sight; to see is not the function of the sense;
externals are not visible; there is no material light;
light is a sensible or mental effect consequent on
the chromatic organ of the brain being excited by
the fluid of the optic nerve. All we know by means
of the optic sense, consists in the sensation of light
or coloured light, accompanied with the idea of
form. The object which promotes the sensation
being, seemingly, the place of the sensation, all
imagine the sensation is the colour of the object to
which the eye is directed, and hence, that the object
or body is seen by the eyes. These general mistakes
are made evident and stand corrected by reference
to the sense itself, its physiology and function, as
previously stated and advised.</p>

<p>The medium of space is the visual medium; not,
however, for looking through, as is supposed, but
by reason of it forming the link or intermediate
means by which the object is connected with the
sense. Now, as the medium of space is present
everywhere, and as it promotes visual or optic perception,
the question naturally arises, why do we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
not see in the night as well as day, in all places and
at all times; in a word, why do we not see in the
dark? The clairvoyant does "see" in the dark.</p>

<p>The nervous fluid excites the sensation of colour;
the medium of space connects mediately the object
with the nervous fluid, which fluid acts on
the optic cerebral organ by pressure and degrees of
pressure. The nervous fluid, nor anything else, acts
essentially, that is, by means of properties and
qualities; and its acting on the brain is caused by
external agency, the fluid itself being <i>inert</i>. It may
well be supposed that the exquisite construction of
the brain, from being competent to produce psychologic
effects, although excited by material agency,
requires but the most simple means, such as a
simple impulse or impression, to be actuated into
excitement; and as the portion or line of the
medium of space which is continuous from the
external object, through the pupil, to the nervous
fluid within the retina, is that which puts the
nervous fluid into functional action on the brain, it
is fairly assumable that only by pressure, degrees,
and changes of pressure, the nervous fluid can
by possibility act on and excite the brain; which
equally applies to the nervous fluid of all the senses.
Taking, then, the maximum of optic pressure as
productive of no sensation; so, from there being no
object to perceive, it is imagined we are surrounded
with darkness; and taking the minimum as exciting
the sensation recognised as luminous, light, or
white, to intermediate degrees of cerebral pressure
are to be attributed the sensations of red, yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
blue and of colours generally. According to these
terms of the colorific scale, all optically-excited
perceptions are consequent on the cerebral pressure
being in degrees on the scale of descent from the
maximum.</p>

<p>For the reduction of optic pressure, there are
different minus-pressure means, namely, the sun,
flame, electricity, phosphoric substances; and the
daily electric matter, which is constant in the atmosphere
at the eastern hemisphere of the globe, and
which keeps pace with the sun; because the rarest
elements of the atmosphere will be in greater quantity
on the side facing the sun. As this daily
electric matter emerges before the sun is above the
<span class="correction" title="In the original book: horiozn">horizon</span>, the general optic pressure excites the sensation
supposed to be the light of day-break; and
while following, after sunset, the sensation is known
as twilight. Any such minus-pressure matter lying
in the visual direction, shortens the visual line, and
intercepts the continuity of that line of the medium
of space which makes one with the axis of the eye,
and thus effects the reduction of optic pressure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The terms here made use of, from being
unknown in the olden philosophy, need explanation.&mdash;<i>Axis
line</i>: that line of the medium of space
which is as the axis of the eye produced to, and
terminated by the external object. <i>Visual line</i>, the
same. <i>Visual continuity</i>; the line which is continuous
<i>angularly</i> with the termination of the axis
line. From the termination of this <i>continuous</i> line,
there may be another angular continuity or <i>line</i>, as
from mirror to mirror. All lines continuous from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
the axis line and terminated by <i>the object</i> supposed
to be seen, and however irregular, are <i>lines</i>
of <i>vision</i>: the angular point, <i>the point of</i> (first,
second, or third) <i>continuity</i>. The reader should
make a diagram for each case as he proceeds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within the window-closed room, a lighted candle
is supposed to fill the entire space with light
radiated from the flame: the perception is named
light, and is thus wise excited. When the axis line is
terminated by the flame, the pressure on the nervous
fluid is lessened to the degree which promotes the
sensation of luminousness, which seems to be the
physical appearance of the flame itself. Again;
when, in the same room, the eye is directed to a
mirror the like perception is excited, because the
visual line is continuous from the point of continuity,
or termination of the axis line, to the flame as
before. When the axis line is terminated by a piece
of furniture, the point of continuity being imperfect
and the visual continuity thence to the flame
irregular or indirect, the optic pressure on the
brain by the axis line excites the sensation of
colour, which is imputed to the object, chair, or
table.</p>

<p>In the celebrated <span class="smcap">Optics</span>, the visual lines are
mistaken for rays of light radiated from the flame,
and reflected from the other objects; which rays are
supposed to enter the eye, and (as if possessed of
intelligence) arrange themselves on the back of the
eye or on the retina, in the precise form, but of a
different size, of the object to which the eyes are
directed, as the means by which externals are seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
before the face. In cases wherein the visual line
is indirect, as when lying through media of unequal
density, the supposed rays are said to be refracted:
and, because the curtained iris excludes the visual
medium, except through the pinhole pupil, thence
along the axis through the lenses of the eyeball, the
<i>optics</i> inculcate, that the eye has been formed to
see only in straight lines. Finally, by Dr. Reed it
is taught, that the use of the sensation and of the
image on the <i>back</i> of the eye, is to make the external
object <i>opposite the face</i> be seen; all which has to be
rejected and forgotten in being guided by the natural,
real function of the sense, against which there is no
appeal. There are no rays concerned; the medium
of vision is quiescent; there can be neither
radiation, reflection, nor refraction effected by passive
inert bodies; there is no image on any part of
the eye or retina; and externals could not be made
visible, or seen by their images. Such absurdities,
all of which are maintained in modern philosophy,
have prevented, more than any thing else, the science
and phenomena of Mesmerism being understood.</p>

<p>According to the interstitial composition of the
surface of a body, so is the point of visual continuity
at or beneath the surface; which determines
the degree of pressure on the axis line; which determines
what shall be the resulting sensation, or apparent
colour of the surface of the object to which the
pupil of the eyeball is directed. Through a pane
of glass, or through the clear atmosphere, the axis
line may be said to be uninterruptedly continuous,
and the perception is as if the glass were away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
Through an ignited sheet of iron the visual continuity
is imperfect, and may be said to be continuous
only halfway through the sheet. An ignited bar,
at first, is said to be brown, then ignited to redness:
colours are sensations. Within the bar the axis
line is continuous in zig-zag order, which causes
the optic pressure to excite the sensation of red: it
is a prismatic case. The <i>spectra</i>, by means of the
prism, are only in the sensorium; the skreen itself
is unseen. When the direct axis line terminates at
the apparent red on the skreen, the continuity
thence is maintained through some particular part
of the prism; when terminated by the yellow,
through a different part; when by the blue, through
another different part; and through each part the
continuity is somewhat curvilinear, hence the pressures
and perceptions are different. Through the air,
when the perception is of the many-coloured rainbow,
the visual continuity is as through the prism:
there is no coloured bow out of the sensorium.</p>

<p>Where there are no minus-pressure means for
lessening the optic pressure, as in mines, caves, and
window-closed rooms, there can be no perceptions
of light and colour. From the sensation ceasing
the same instant the last window-shutter is closed,
it would seem, that, the <i>daily</i> minus-pressure matter
is in constant flow eastward through the globe.
The rheumatic sufferer fears sun-down, as if the
daily matter enters and protects the nerves from
the nightly. The meteorologist has to resolve the
problem for the philosopher in tracing the magnetic
meridian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The objection is unfounded against pressure being
the cerebral exciting cause. It is objected, that, from
two stars equally distant, one considered red, the
other blue, the pressure cannot be changed along the
visual lines in the small space of time the eye takes
to direct itself from one to the other star. There
is no changing of pressure on either line. The
existing pressure on the sense by each is different,
and what it is, depends on the constitution of the
external object, as in every other instance, and just
as on that of the ignited bar already stated. The
imputed colours of the stars being different, so is
the continuity of axis line beneath the surface of the
atmosphere of each star, also the degree of pressure
and the sensitive result.</p>

<p>Neither is it maintainable that the medium of space
cannot be the medium of vision, because "from
being all-pervading, it should excite vision through
all kinds of bodies, as through a block of rock crystal,
but does not through so thin a substance as a leaf of
blotting-paper." By clairvoyance it is proved that
the visual continuity is maintained through stone
walls; and by reason of the <i>visual and auditory</i>
medium being the same, that is, medium of space,
the "hearing" through stone walls, makes the
"seeing" possible. The bell must be connected mediately
with the auditory sense, as is the object with
the visual sense; and through stone walls there is
nothing continuous but the medium of space. Sound
is no more a transmissible object than colour;
neither belongs to the external object. In all such
cases of sensations which are different, although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
promoting means are the same for all the senses,
that the organs of sense may not be equally susceptible,
or capable of being put into functional
service by the same degree of cerebral pressure,
should be held in mind, or else it might be asked

<h2><a name="TRANSPARENCY" id="TRANSPARENCY"></a>TRANSPARENCY.</h2>


<p>A transparent body, is one through which the
visual line is uninterruptedly continuous from an
object to the sense. The materials for glass-making
are opaque, and the natural opacity of their elementary
atoms is unalterable. Hence in some novel
arrangement of the atoms towards promoting the
direct continuity of the medium of space through
them, consists the object of vitrifying and principle
of transparency.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
</div>
<div class="chap">
<h2><a name="OPACITY" id="OPACITY"></a>OPACITY.</h2>


<p>The principal obstacle to transparency is interposed
electric matter. In the earliest stages of
glass-making an immense volume of electric matter
is got rid of by means of the furnace fire, which
becomes sooty smoke while ascending and passing
through the furnace funnel; and to prevent all
return of the like, it is, that solid oxygen is added
to the materials when fused, the interstices of
which, in the vitrified mass, secure the direct continuity
of the visual medium. Priestley made black
wax and brass filings transparent, by only removing
all interposed electric matter. The body of a living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
man, by being de-electrised, has been made transparent.
In these instances the transparency is of
short continuance, and the opacity is restored by
returning electric matter. Fire, in de-electrising
gems and crystals, destroys all partial opacity.
The clearest water is made cloudy on receiving
the charge from the electrifying jar; by uncustomary
electric matter, the atmosphere is made
foggy, and is transparent again when the electric
matter becomes a constituent of rain-water. These
instances show, that, electric matter lying in the
way of the medium of space and vision, interrupts
its regular continuity, consequently, its direct
pressure; yet not wholly,&mdash;clairvoyance and sound
make manifest that the continuity is maintained
through the most opaque bodies. The principle
bears strongly on the physiology of clairvoyance.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NERVOUS_FLUID" id="THE_NERVOUS_FLUID"></a>THE NERVOUS FLUID.</h2>


<p>Were there a distinct fluid belonging to the
nerves of sensation, and insulated, it could not be
affected by external circumstances, nor its cerebral
excitement be productive in the least of any knowledge,
relative or inferential of external bodies. Were
the fluid not insulated, it should be subject to waste
like the lachrymal fluid, and must excite the brain
differently at different times, even under equal
circumstances; which must make it impossible to
identify the same body after its removal out of the
axis-of-vision direction.</p>

<p>A distinct fluid, not insulated, has to be in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>tact
with the line of medium of space which the external
object terminates, which adds to the difficulty
of waste, in the possibility of the nerves becoming
flooded with an abnormal fluid, medium of space.
Much more likely is it, that, <i>the cerebral exciting
fluid, of the nerves generally, consists in medium of
space</i>, received from without through the cuticular
insertions and orifices of the nerves as streamlets
from the great ocean of space, subject to neither
ebb nor flow, and liable to change of pressure
occasioned by external agency. According to this
idea, the object and brain are the terms of the
visual line; and medium of space, continuous from
the object through the nerves to the brain, is the
connecting link.</p>

<p>Further; although medium of space is the nervous
fluid and immediate cerebral exciting cause,
(which entitles it to be named the <span class="smcap">true</span> <i>nervous
fluid</i>,) there are strong grounds for concluding
that, with the true fluid, the nerves include a pair
of correlative elements. Because of the mesmeric
effected polarities being without the comatose flow,
which leaves nothing to look to for the polarizing
means but the contents of the nerves. Next, as
clairvoyance is a cerebral effect, something connected
with the nervous fluid must be concerned in
its production, or why not clairvoyance take place
without the magnetic passes. Finally, the true
fluid, or any single fluid, is incapable of being
polarized; and the true fluid might be rendered
immovable at times, were there no electric or minus-pressure
matter within the nerves, also to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
its increase, and to retain the normal quantity of the
true fluid. All extremes being prevented, and the
polarities of the extremities productive of increased
lucidity, are consistent with idea of the nerves including
magnetising correlatives, which, beside, serve
as an elastic break against the fluid exciting the
brain indistinctly, irregularly, or exquisitely; and
only, as it were, muffled, to prevent the sensibility
of the cerebral organs being worn out prematurely.</p>

<p>Another object may be attained by the included
electric correlatives, namely, restricting the exciting
pressure to certain degrees, so that the sensation
shall be defined and directing, but otherwise useless
and misleading. Another may be, that of regulating
the degrees of pressure on such a scale, as that,
by the same senses, sensations shall be excited as
different from each other as those of red, yellow,
and blue by the optic sense, heat and cold by the
feeling sense, sweet and bitter by the gustory sense.
To which the conjecture may be added, for the
purpose of anatomic and physiologic inquiry, that,
as not even an elementary interstice is without
design, so may the orifices of the retina be of regulated
diameters, to ensure such definite degrees of
pressure on the brain as shall excite the sensations
recognised as primitive colours.</p>

<p>On the principle that the nervous fluid is derived
from without, the question is decided as to the
cuticular termination of the nerves, which is objected
to by some, in consequence of a few of the
nerves being observed to have "inward bending."
And is it not a matter of common observation, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
"feeling is most sensible at the tips of the
fingers" or apparent place of the sensation.</p>

<h2><a name="CLAIRVOYANCE" id="CLAIRVOYANCE"></a>CLAIRVOYANCE.</h2>


<p>All mesmerically-produced phenomena are the
consequence of the passes. The immediate effect of
the passes is de-electrisation of the nerves, that is,
of their contents, which leaves them polarised (as is
the case in natural sleep), but more intensely than is
effected by the comatose flow. In the ordinary condition,
the contents of the nerves may be likened to
milky water in a barometer tube; in natural sleep,
to the same, with a less degree of milkiness&mdash;the
latter subsiding from the ends to the middle portion
of the water; and in the clairvoyant condition of
the nerves, to the milkiness having so completely
subsided as to leave the water above and below the
middle of the tube transparent. In the ordinary
condition, the nervous fluid is clogged, as it were,
with intermixed electric matter, which, by marring
the regular continuity of the fluid from without to
the brain, reduces in some degree the exciting
pressure on the brain, which prevents the function
of the fluid being employed to its utmost. In this
encumbered state, the fluid may be said to act on
the brain, as the clapper when muffled on a bell.
Still the excited pressure is sufficiently strong, and
the mental result sufficiently distinct for all human
purposes. When to the clairvoyant degree the
nerves have been denuded of impeding electric
matter, the nervous fluid is enabled to act on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
brain as if unmuffled; and as its continuity from
the orifices of the retina through space is not in any
manner altered, so, to the altered electric condition,
mesmerically effected, on the contents of the nerves
between their orifices and the brain, we must attribute
all mesmerically produced phenomena; and
without supposing that the brain is quickened
into a higher degree of sensibility, or that any one
of its various organs has acquired some exalted
degree of psychologic ability.</p>

<p>That <i>long vision</i> and <i>opaque vision</i> should be consequences
of cleansing, as it were, the nerves of
intercepting minus-pressure matter, is nothing surprising,
it is as removing dust from the window to
better our vision: the physiology is traceable, and
the psychology not more incomprehensible than its
hourly occurrence in a minor degree, to which, as
sensible effects, we are indebted for all we know,
and by which we abide, without inquiry into their
nature or origin; so perfect is the design of Nature
in our make for supplying all that is requisite to
the comfort and enjoyment of man in his present
state of existence.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="LONG_VISION" id="LONG_VISION"></a>Long vision</h3>
<p class="p-h3">, during the clairvoyant state, or the
recognition of objects greatly remote by the sensation
each promotes, has its wonder much more in
the <i>nature of the medium of space</i> than in the
familiar mental effect. The optically promoted sensation
is proof that the external object, were it at
the antipodes, is in mediate connection with not
only the nervous fluid of the retina, but the brain.
Long and ordinary vision have the same theory: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
both states the same chromatic cerebral organ is
excited by the nervous fluid; in both the nervous fluid
is continuous from the brain to the external body;
and in both the object perceived is the sensation of
colour. That the eye-ball lenses are concerned in
long and opaque, as in short vision, however in the
two former, the eyes may be bandaged (to satisfy
the desire of spectators, otherwise useless, if not
worse,) is obvious, from the knowledge of form being
connected with the sensation, as in every instance
of optically-excited perception.</p>
</div>

<p>By the passes, the nervous fluid is freed from the
visual intercepting electric matter; which matter,
like the colouring matter in stained glass, renders
the continuity of the visual medium or fluid within
the optic nerve impaired.</p>

<p>To account for the phenomenon of much longer
than ordinary vision, there is nothing in the mesmeric
case to effect the difference, or refer to, but
the de-electrised condition of the nervous fluid.
From which it would seem that the visual line from
the most remote object, is always as continuous to
the brain as from one within arm's length before
the face; and that the degree of cerebral exciting
pressure on the longer line is rendered equally efficacious,
<i>now</i>, that the electric impediment has been
removed from the nervous fluid; hence, that the
normal intermixed quantity of electric matter with
the nervous fluid prevents us being clairvoyant at
all times, is reasonable to conclude.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="OPAQUE_VISION" id="OPAQUE_VISION"></a>Opaque vision</h3>
<p class="p-h3">, or the "seeing through opaque
bodies," is not the absurdity so generally imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
when judged and reasoned on according to the true
principles of visual perception: the facts of clairvoyance
place the absurdity on the denier.</p>
</div>

<p>As the medium of space furnishes all the nerves
with the true and only cerebral exciting fluid, which
is necessarily all-pervading, and proved to be so by
the auditory sense, or "hearing through stone
walls," the possibility of seeing through such bodies
is made manifest, and <i>clairvoyantly</i>, has been
proved. Misled by the idea that the eye-balls look
through solid glass, yet cannot look through a stone,
to doubt and deny is pardonable; yet nothing else
is requisite, than that the visual medium shall be
continuous from the object to the brain, no matter
how many opaque objects lie between, for the perception
being excited, and promoted by the remote
object: the object perceived is the sensation of this or
that colour, as in transparent vision. It is no ordinary
circumstance, that of "seeing through opaque
bodies;" neither is it an ordinary circumstance, the
extreme de-electrised condition of the nervous
fluid, <i>on which the extra-ordinary of the phenomenon
depends</i>. In removing the partial opacity of a
crystal by means of fire, the hindrance to the visual
continuity, electric matter, is displaced; but as no
such electric displacement from a stone wall is
effected or practicable, while to the clairvoyant the
continuity is as were there no electric impediment
in the wall, is proof additional that the medium of
space, the common cerebral exciting cause, pervades
all things, the human body included, and
hence the being in <i>Report</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Now that mesmeric practice and proof have stifled
all open opposition, by the influential ignorant, to
the surprising truths of the science, that all persons
cannot be mesmerised to the clairvoyant stage, is in
nowise prejudicial to mesmerism, or to the <span class="smcap">science
of the economy</span> being intimately connected with
medical practice; neither are occasional failures by
the clairvoyant, especially in trial tests, some of
which exhibit samples of complicated confusion, as
if for the purpose of suppression, instead of laudably
exalting the all-important science of mesmerism.
Had the very liberal offer of a hundred
pounds been under less complicated conditions,
the bank-note most certainly would have been
deciphered and changed hands. Had the note been
spread open, while enclosed between two plates of
sheet-iron, and then read by the clairvoyant, the
test would have been sufficient to convince the
most steady, sturdy, staunch unbeliever, and the
<i>dénouement</i> affirmative to every dispassionate observer.
But from being folded line upon line, letter
on letter, at least three deep, the misarrangement
destroyed most effectually all reading order. A
Newtonian would say, that, "the commixed rays
proceeding from the several overlaid typographic
characters, and from the lines placed tier over
tier, could never form the image of even a single
letter on the retina, with anything resembling
legible clearness;" therefore the trial must fail
most inevitably.</p>

<p>None deny that rigidity of the limbs can be
effected mesmerically; but all mistake who impute
the phenomenon to muscular ability, irritability, or
energy. All flesh is <i>inert</i>; all muscular fibrine is
flexible, bends from its own weight when held
horizontally, and over it the will has neither power
nor influence. Then, how is a muscle or nerve to
stiffen itself, and where is the mechanical arrangement
within for such purpose? The power is
derived from without, and consists in medium of
space. The de-electrising passes make entrance-room
for influent medium of space, which is the
cause of the limbs becoming rigid. As in Bramah's
pump, water serves the purpose of an iron piston,
so, within the nerves and muscles, medium of space
in excess and under the general pressure, is an
equally rigid piston, and the cause of all muscular
strength and of rigidity. The depolarizing passes
bring back electric matter, which displaces all
excess of medium of space, and with it the physical
cause of rigidity.</p>

<p class="p-h3">&mdash;
The curative principle of mesmerism seems to
consist in correcting occasional irregularities in the
<i>electric circulation</i>. By the passes, electric matter
in excess is removed, which, from being noxious to
the part, might contribute to the formation of mucus
to become concrete, or otherwise injurious to the
flesh: or, the passes may transfer the excess to
supply deficiency elsewhere,&mdash;as in the case of gout,
a disease of the sufferer's own making, from excess
of de-electrising food and drink, which uncoats and
unlines the nerves, and thus leaves the nervous fluid,
from casual circumstances, to almost lacerate the
brain. Stomach coating aliment, not denuding
physic, is the cure: as electric matter may become
a constituent of the humidities of the different
organs, so may it of the serous fluid, which is
indispensable to wholesome flesh. In all such cases
mesmerism is curative.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="ETHERS" id="ETHERS"></a><span class="correction" title="Inserted from the Table of Contents.">Ethers.</span></h3>
<p class="p-h3">&mdash;
From inhaled <i>ethers</i>, producing insensibility without
rigidity, it would seem that they contribute a kind
of electric matter to the interior of the nerves, but
which, from being uncongenial, is happily soon displaced.
All excess being the more prejudicial, the
quicker the displacement the better. Any ether
imparted to the fluids of the nerves, may effect reduction
in the quantity of the true fluid through the
cuticle orifices; or make breaks in what is left,
so as to leave the nervous fluid incompetent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
produce excitement of the brain; hence the insensibility
of the patient, if that can be considered
insensibility, when there is nothing of pain of which
to be insensible.</p>
</div>

<p>Etherising by external application, but which
may not amount to mesmerizing, is nothing new.
A Dublin apothecary, sixty years since, cured the
poor daily of nervous complaints, headaches especially,
by pressing a folded handkerchief on the
forehead, taken from a wide-mouth jar, concealed
with professional delicacy, behind the counter, but
long since discontinued; the learned in the laws of
life and living, considering that short-hand work is
a forbidden practice,&mdash;that something newest in the
last <i>Pharmacop&oelig;ia</i> is better than the best, for all
parties. Tobacco-smoking brings on a degree of
insensibility, and mesmerically conduces to sleep,
which exertion frustrates. The smoke of the fire
in London stayed the plague in the year 1666.
The subject is worthy of consideration by the mesmerizing
physician, in case of epidemics especially.</p>

<h2><a name="REPORT" id="REPORT"></a>REPORT.</h2>


<p>The being in report one with another, the mesmerised
with the mesmeriser, is proved possible,
and from being effected by the passes is proved
also to be natural,&mdash;not satanic or supernatural, the
weakest of all ideas. Within Nature there can be
nothing supernatural; nor out of Nature, or of the
other worlds, anything in the power of living man or
poor human nature to command or imitate. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>ever,
as believers are not reasoners, except in the
arithmetic of funds, to the reformer <i>Time</i>, must be
left the conversion to Reason.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of Nature there is nothing
insulated, not even an atom. Involved in a universal
medium of pressure, all things must be in contact,
mediate or immediate. The atmosphere is a
universal connecting link. As by the sea the most
distantly-situated islands are in mediate connection,
so are all mankind by means of the atmosphere.
Still this atmospheric connection is limited to margin
with margin, surface with surface. By the all-pervading
medium of space, the interior of all living
beings is in mediate connection, equally as the interior
of submerged sponges by the water. As
"light" would pervade and connect our bodies
were they glass, so does the medium of space. But
were mankind so left, it is difficult to conceive how
the organic functions could possibly take place, and
impossible to say how personal individuality could
be, as at present, an independent animal privilege.</p>

<p>Although the medium of space is continuous
through all bodies, the regular continuity is impaired
by the elements of the atmosphere between
each. The atmosphere not only protects all living
bodies against the maximum and all excess of pressure,
but in some considerable degree insulates the
bodies of persons from each other, just as fog and
small snow intercept the visual continuity and would
render "rays of light" interruptedly continuous; so
do the intermixed atoms of the atmosphere the regular
continuity of the medium of space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
person and person, as respects surfaces. Within the
body, insulation is still more complete: here, electric
matter and air abound to the exclusion of all
excess of medium of space; by which the different
organs remain, in a manner disconnected, or so far,
as that the functional action of each organ has its
distinct period, instead of the action of the whole
being simultaneously performed. Beside these
means and degrees of insulation, the non-conducting
coating and lining of the nerves insulate more completely
their elementary contents, by which the
nerves are not only tubes of separation but insulation,
and are direct conducting channels of the
nervous fluid through the body from its external
source to the brain.</p>

<p>Although man is thus isolated from man, the
isolating means do not prevent the medium of
space being continuous through all, and from one
to another; which is manifested by the clairvoyant,
who has the like of the sensation excited in the
brain of the mesmeriser repeated or excited in his
own brain; as when the mesmeriser masticates and
the sensation of the same flavour is known by the
mesmerised. The sensation is nothing transferable;
taste is not by the tongue; hence, by the sensation
being excited in succession in the brain of each
person, is the only conceivable mode, in reason,
why the second should know what the first is masticating.
The nervous fluid of the two may be
supposed to be derived from the medium of space
between them; then, by the medium of space lying
between, the nervous fluids of the two are rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
continuous one with the other, and is so at all
times, but only when the nervous fluid is mesmerically
de-electrised is it productive of clairvoyant
perceptions. Community of sensation, or the <i>same</i>
sensation being perceived by different persons, is an
impossibility. The first sensation is only where it
has been excited, in the brain of the mesmeriser; and
supposing the matter of the nervous fluid continuous
direct from his brain to that of the patient, in it,
what has the latter to perceive?&mdash;nothing; neither
is perception separable in idea from the result of
cerebral excitement. It is to be hoped that the
desultory ideas here advanced may tend to a better
knowledge on this singular mesmeric discovery.
Even the foregoing may be objected to with apparent
reason, on consideration of what is termed "community
of thought," wherein there is no previous
sensation to be repeated. To account for which
requires more cerebral information than has as yet
been brought to light; when satisfactorily known it
may show, whether or not community in dreaming
may be effected. Report would be impossible were
there not intimate connection of brain with brain.</p>

<p>Every motion of the limbs being effected by pressure,
to promote the local change minus-pressure
matter has to be displaced. That the assent of will
is indispensable is evident, inasmuch as there is no
<i>ordinary</i> limb motion, if not previously assented
to by the will. Yet will is no mechanical power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
nor anything having a distinct existence. Will
seems to be, the mutual accordance of the cerebral
organs to act together so as to effect, or rather
assist, the accomplishing of a present intention. The
act may be likened to that of suction, voluntarily performed
by the brain to de-electrise itself, in order to
make room for and receive that which lies in the
way of the desired object being effected. The voluntary
act by the brain cannot be on anything far
away, or not in contact with the brain, and that
which is acted on must be continuous to the place of
the removable impediment. If, then, the brain does
de-electrise itself, and that by so doing it receives
electric matter from the nerves which are continuous
from the limb to the brain, such removal of
electric matter is effected within the nerves of the
limb, as makes space for medium of space to enter
in the requisite quantity to move the limb according
to the required velocity. It is not to be overlooked,
that, previous to the self de-electrisation of
the brain, thought may be concerned in promoting
the cerebral de-electrising act. So far as the foregoing
may be true, the like circumstances take place
when the mesmeriser wills into report with himself
the far-off patient, the electric matter in the space
between being affected with as much facility, as the
transfer of similar matter from the trough to the
utmost extent of the galvanic wire, which may be
considered instantaneous, considering the hundreds
of miles distance between.</p>

body to a different, seems to belong, in some necessary
degree, to all bodies possessed of life. The
object is to make space for medium of space to
enter, and by its pressure to put the animal in a
state of locomotion. The snake, worm, and snail
do so to be pressed onward along the ground; the
oyster, to have the shells firmly collapsed; the limpit,
to be pressed against the rock; and each, cerebrally
wills the replacement of electric matter to displace
the cause of pressure, medium of space, for the
grovelling reptile to be at rest&mdash;the oyster, that the
shells may be opened; the limpit, when willing to
fall into the water. The fly, lizard, and walrus, so
de-electrise the body, as to reverse the direction of
what is supposed to be their natural weight, by
which means each becomes pressed upwards, and
walks with the back downwards&mdash;which, to be consistent
with the established philosophy, should be
considered <i>repellent gravitation</i>. The goat voluntarily
de-electrises his body to have it pressed with
double force against the slippery rock; the lynx, to
have mesmeric long vision; the cat, to have opaque
vision, or "see through the dark;" the fire-fly, to
effect reduction of the optic pressure productive of
sensations of colour. The carrier-pigeon effects
self de-electrisation to the clairvoyant degree, by
which the external object, the turret at Constantinople,
promotes the sensation which indicates at
once the shortest direction of flight from London
to the birth-place of the bird. The eagle de-electrises
itself inwardly, the same as if by the mesmeric
passes, to promote olfactory lucidity, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
which to ascertain the presence of carrion on the
ground. Fishes effect internal de-electrisation, somehow
by means of the contents of the swim, for
influent medium of space to propel the body with
a velocity superior to the power of the short, flexible
fins. The flight of birds is not effected by wing
motion, or wing powers. The crow, eagle, and kite
sail in all directions on extended motionless wing,
and the odd wing-flap now and then given, is only
to assist in keeping the body in the necessary electric
condition. The swallow is darted most rapidly
through the air with closed wing, and changes
acutely, without way, the direction of flight, by
changing instantaneously the direction of impulse.
With the greatest wing-agitation the hawk remains
at times stationary in the air. The fish, bird, and
bullet are impelled by the same cause, pressure, by
the medium of space on the de-electrised rear.</p>
</div>

<p>The cow and goat voluntarily de-electrise the
cud, for medium of space to enter and press it
upwards through the food-passage which the cud
presses against, instead of being raised by nerves or
muscles of the esophagus. In parturition also, and the
discharge of the feces, the same principles are maintained.
The "throes of Nature" are consequent on
the natural pressure being made intermitting, by
electric matter returning to and escaping from the
birth at intervals. The physiologist may refer to
muscular action; but where are the delivery muscles?
The stage-dancer makes de-electrising efforts to
receive medium of space, by which to be lifted
above the boards and supported a few seconds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
the air. Muscles at full stretch in opposite directions,
and the fulcrum, if any, being carried by
them, is out of all dynamic rule. All persons make
a de-electrising effort previous to the leap-spring,
and while continuing to stand or run and tiptoe,
without being aware of the reason; and the fatigue
is not muscular, but in keeping the body fittingly
de-electrised.</p>

<p>The <i>gymnotus electricus</i> kills the distant prey
instantaneously, which receives nothing whatever of
missile from the enemy; nor could the latter be
accessary to the death-stroke, were there nothing
between to connect one with the other: nothing
passing and no connecting means, no outstretched
arm or instrument touching that which is to be
acted on, is a mechanical absurdity, and is attributing
an effect to that which, it may be said, is an absent
cause. The eel voluntarily performs the cerebral
operation on the electric matter which is continuous
from itself through the air to the marked prey,
which effects instantaneous removal of the same
matter from the prey; which permits medium of
space at the same instant to give the de-electrised
part the death-blow.</p>

<h2><a name="APPLICATION_OF_MESMERISM" id="APPLICATION_OF_MESMERISM"></a>APPLICATION OF MESMERISM.</h2>


<p>First. A National Asylum, to be named, <span class="smcap">The
British Mesmeric Institution</span>, should be founded
and endowed. England should take the lead. A
Professorship of Magnetism should be founded. All
Sanatory Asylums to be obliged to furnish their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
experience periodically, and be under control of the
Institution, which should be possessed of power to
undiploma the medical practitioner who refuses to
mesmerise. Self-mesmerising to Clairvoyance, to be
taught, which is as teachable as ventriloquism; the
principle is the same of both,&mdash;the theory is that of
sound.</p>

<p>Through self-mesmerising, the blind and eyeless
would be extricated occasionally from the shadow
leading to the valley of death and be enabled to
follow some useful calling. Some blind, illiterate
clairvoyant, may have superior <i>connoisseurship</i>, entitling
him to fill the academic chair. Through
mesmerism the resuscitating process can be brought
under rules of science. Through clairvoyance the
geography of the globe may yet be improved; the
northern passage discovered; the astronomer assisted
in his stellar speculations beyond the possibility
of mere telescopic discovery. On ship-board,
the voluntary clairvoyant may make discovery of
the haze-hidden lighthouse and wave-hidden shoal.
In the hands of the clairvoyant the telescope and
microscope, will, in time, make us acquainted
with other worlds, other beings, and other of the
wonderful works of the <span class="smcap">Great God of Nature</span>!</p>

<p>The Seeker after God from the book of God's
own composing, the holy volume of his own works,
through voluntary clairvoyance, will feel himself in
the enjoyment of a second nature, the fit inhabitant
of an intellectual world, in which the powers of
thought are without limits. And who can say what
discovery of abstract truths may not be elicited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
from the conversation of two or more clairvoyants
in mutual report, all of exalted talent and superior
education? Other worlds, ere this be past, may
open to our view, and their inhabitants become clairvoyantly
familiar to human observation. The idea
is pregnant with hope; it presumes that we are not
inhabitants of only the earth, but the universe;
which may be considered a natural, <i>never</i>-dying
hope. Why, then, should the science be opposed
which has already been so beneficial to our species,
and promises to make known the never yet discovered
wonders of the animal economy? Surely
they will be yet ashamed of having done those things,
the fruit of which is the bitterness of remorse.</p>

<h2><a name="CONTINUOUS_MOTION" id="CONTINUOUS_MOTION"></a>CONTINUOUS MOTION.</h2>


<p>The motion which continues after the body has
ceased to be in contact with the <i>sensible</i> impelling
cause, is named continuous motion. The body
impelled receives neither force nor motion from the
impelling cause: neither force nor motion is anything
transferrable or anything communicable; forcible
velocity and change of place are but accidents of
matter, and but local, casual circumstances of
bodies. Being <i>inert</i>, the body cannot move itself.
Motion, therefore, is but a physical effect, and must
have a cause equal to the duration of the effect:
motion after impulse has ceased, would be effect
without cause&mdash;which is an absurdity and impossibility;
therefore impulse is constant as motion, however
insensible the impelling cause. These dynamic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
principles cannot be too frequently brought to mind,
considering the general erroneous opinion on the
subject which maintains, that "a body continues in
motion because it cannot stop itself;" which is effect
without its equal of cause.</p>

<p>A body in motion is under unequal pressure on
opposite sides, greater on the rear than front. The
air in front resists, that in the rear may be said to
recede from the body; therefore neither impels the
projectile. Under such circumstances there remains
but the alternative, that of the electric constitution
of the body being changed by the previous
impulse, by which medium of space accumulates
on one side, or decreases on the opposite. The
phenomenon admits of being thus illustrated:</p>

<p>The first, previous or sensible impulse, effects
de-electrisation of the body on the rear or side of
impulse; influent medium of space immediately
occupies the vacated rear, and by its pressure impels
the body through the air. The velocity of the
previous impulse, gives momentum to the body
greater than the included freely-removable elementary
matter can obtain; of consequence the latter
is left behind in the air, and the pressure of the
acquired medium of space in the rear, is the continuous
impelling cause. Thus is the mistake of
Dugald Stuart made evident, that "motion is the
immediate and only effect of impulse."</p>

<p>It is not the air's resistance which makes the
motion of a projectile decline and end. Taking
impulse as ten, resistance four, there remains six
degrees of unresisted impulse, which should impel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
the body for ever through the atmosphere. The
decline and cessation of impulse is that which brings
the projectile to rest.</p>

<p>From the instant the body has ceased to be in
contact with the sensible impelling cause, electric
matter is re-entering the rear, which displaces
gradually the impelling medium; and as are the
increments of the former, so are the decrements of
the latter, and so is the decline of motion.</p>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="ASCENDING_AND_DESCENDING_MOTION" id="ASCENDING_AND_DESCENDING_MOTION"></a>Ascending and Descending Motion.</h3>
<p class="p-h3">&mdash;The rear of
the vertically-impelled body becomes vacated of
minus-pressure matter, and replaced with medium
of space; by the latter, and general pressure, the
body is forced upwards as a cork by water. While
ascending, the rear is acquiring electric matter and
losing the impelling medium,&mdash;the velocity of course
declines; and when at the highest, the body is at
rest in the air for an instant, then is precipitated to
the ground. During the entire of the descent,
electric matter is vacating the rear and medium of
space entering, consequently the fall is accelerated.
Now as the body cannot fall of itself; as descending
motion is of increasing velocity, while motion
in every other direction is retarded; and, because
all descent has the same <i>centripetal</i> direction, so
should there be some distinct cause to produce
these conspicuous effects, which, to trace, suggest
the following hypothesis:</p>
</div>

<div class="div-h3">
<h3><a name="CENTRIPETAL_FLOW" id="CENTRIPETAL_FLOW"></a>Centripetal Flow.</h3>
<p class="p-h3">&mdash;The different motions of the
globe affect all bodies on its surface, so as to
appear to the inhabitants as if the whole were at
rest; supposing thence, that the centre of the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
is the centre of motion, the following may be considered
probable consequences:&mdash;The general pressure
being less at the centre and axis than on the
surface of the earth, obliges the medium of space
to flow through the atmosphere and entire surface,
<i>centripetally</i>, to the centre, thence along the axis,
carrying with it electric matter, and has exit at the
poles, which polarizes the globe and produces the
boreales. The centripetal flow retains the atmosphere
to the earth; precipitates bodies from the air
in a centripetal direction; accelerates the descent;
and retards all motion not in its own direction: it
prevents vertical ascent being equal to impulse, the
difference being employed in bearing against the
flow. The flow makes bodies ponderate or have
weight, causes the dip and direction of the compass-needle.</p>
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
</div>
<div class="chap">
<h2><a name="FORMATION_OF_A_PLANET" id="FORMATION_OF_A_PLANET"></a>FORMATION OF A PLANET.</h2>


<p>That cannot be considered a chaotic state from
which the eternal order sprung; nor that a created
body, the substance of which previously existed,
which was and is common to all bodies. Hence it
may be concluded that a planet is a natural production,
equally as the instantly-formed ponderous
atmospheric aërolite, supposed to have come from
the moon.</p>

<p>From the elementary to the aëriform, thence the
aqueous state, seems the simplest and primeval
order of atomic combination. Hence it is conceivable,
that, were an immense volume of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
elements collected together in the regions of space,
and subjected to extreme pressure, the result would
be an aqueous sphere, with an attached residue of
the same elements to serve as a primeval atmosphere
to receive increase from future mists and
exhalations. While aqueous and with one side only
of the sphere facing the sun, the elements of the
water cannot avoid being in a state of constant disturbance
and transfer, productive of combinations,
formations, and precipitations until the equilibrium
has obtained, leaving ultimately the solid masses so
formed, as they would now appear were the ocean
away: the original water, from having contributed
the elements of the newly-formed solids, being
reduced in quantity and changed in quality, is left
as the ocean is at present, saline. During the
intermediate plastic state, and as induration increased,
the endowed fertility may have produced
<i>kinds</i>, many of which have become extinct.</p>

<p>It may be further assumed, that deep within the
planet the elements abound in neither kind nor
quantity as at the surface and in the atmosphere;
and if the imponderable oxygen element be absent,
an immense mass of ice would form the nucleus
of the earth, the occasional melting at the surface
of which, in the neighbourhood of sulphurous and
ferruginous masses, may cause those volcanic eruptions
from which no region of the earth is free.
Thus it would seem that a planet may be the
natural formation of an instant, requiring time for
completion, and may be an everyday circumstance
in space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>The strict inquirer into terrestrial magnetism has
to ascertain, whether the non-conducting central
ice be not the means, some how, of separating the
correlative fluids which the centripetal flow carries
with it along the axis through the Poles, and which
make the Poles magnetic opposites; or, whether, of
these fluids, one only is transmissible through ice.</p>

<p>A planet may be subject to wear and the fertility
to decrease, thence to be uninhabitable, as Herschel
describes the very probable condition of the moon,
owing to the rapid motion through space, solar
effects and cultivation. The idea is neither gloomy
nor a threatened dread. Man was born to leave
this world, and live where <span class="smcap">God</span> has pleased. Some
anticipate the night, when we shall see "our
God in terror, and our world on fire!"&mdash;"undoing
all, as all had never been," or made in vain. But
He who blessed and never cursed his works, whose
mercy and goodness endureth for ever, and who
will "save both man and beast," is not a God
of terror!</p>

<p>Why the planets are moved round the sun, all in
the same direction, excites speculation in the absence
of demonstration. Let it be supposed that the
inequalities in a newly-formed planet prevent the
body being at rest under the general pressure; in
which case the planet is put into its primeval
motion, and in the direction of the strongest impulsive
pressure. But as the like inequalities precisely,
cannot present in every new planet, neither could
the motion of all be in the same direction, which
gives room for conceiving the probability that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
portion of the medium, however extensive, in which
the solar system is involved, revolves round the
sun, or round the orbit of the sun, and that its
motion is promoted by the sun in the solar orbit,&mdash;which
orbit may probably be promoted by the
rarity of the elements in the solar regions. The
medium of space so revolving, determines the direction
of all the planets, which by the hypothesis
must be the same as that of the revolving medium.</p>

<p>By some such means only is it conceivable how
solar matter can arrive at Neptune, the Earth, or
even Mercury,&mdash;the <i>inert</i> sun being incapable of
radiating anything from itself, and solar atoms
requiring a physical impelling cause, in motion, and
acting on the rear of each from the sun to the
extreme of planetary space. A circulating medium
of constantly-increasing radius, appears indispensably
necessary for the purpose of conveying solar
matter through the regions of space, and for the
maintaining all planetary motion in the same uniform
direction. The subject is open to all, and worthy
of notice: what is now advanced will be passed
over, from having no mathematical appendage, but
which, makes even false causes pass for the demonstrated
truth. The mathematical science has not
to this day demonstrated the cause of planetary
motion,&mdash;a subject wholly indifferent to modern
astronomy, in which the false, self-gravitation, in
connection with <i>inertia</i>, satisfies all as long as the
astronomer remains self-satisfied.</p>

A <i>Comet</i> may have been a planet by formation,
and impelled, before completion, immeasurably far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
beyond the sun. The tail is probably the primitive
atmosphere, left behind and pressed after the body
as towards a sheltering wall; the <i>coma</i> may be
electric matter collected on the front, and subject
to increase, which, by lessening pressure on the
side facing the direction of motion, and without
increased pressure on the opposite side, may cause
the velocity of the planet to be subject to acceleration,
or prevent the motion being equitable: the
reticulated tail may serve to collect all redundant
solar matter in space, after planetary use, for deposit
in the solar regions, or the sun as the heart
of the system, for future circulation. Were the
tail to approach the earth sufficiently near, the
waters of the sea would be pressed upwards as
towards an immense water-spout; in which case
the rivers must become drained; and as the Comet
recedes from the earth, the fall of the immense
column would produce <i>another general deluge</i> over
one hemisphere, at least, of the globe! The deposits
from a comet's tail may occasion those nebulocities
named solar spots.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
